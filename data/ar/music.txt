the irreverent , multi-talented musician reinvents herself yet again with this fabulous collection of sound . lady madonna doesn't get older - she just gets better !
this was a free song and after listen it to a few times , i would say the they are alright .
this is a great lively album with a few slow songs , but mostly it makes you want to get up and dance .
a good song for what it is , nice fast beat and nice singer . very electro sounding . i like it for what it is .
good song at first , but once you hear over and over it is nothing more than aggravating . amazon had the best price , kids wanted it .
shes just getting better and better like a fine winei am very please with her efforts on her second cdshe rocks damn it
i bought this because of the newer album which i heard first . all good ! check it out if you want something to relax to .
the best set of songs and most hardrocking set by the moodies . good album.they tried to get away from overdubbing here so they could do it live .
the case was pretty warn , yes . that didn't really matter to me , much . played perfectly , no skips or scratches . overall pretty great .
terrible album , not a real disaster like tony yayo's album , but still only 3 or 4 enjoyable tracks on this whole album . thumbs down !
i been looking for this cd for a long time , very hard cd to find and glad i found it .
if you liked the beastie boys growing up or have never listened , this is the album to get ! trust me

it began by looking for pieces of music to walk to and i found it with this song . lots of fun .
i really like this it was in the limited red vinyl , plays reallly good.great songs like mirrior on the wall and president carter
smooth rich and creamy in the delivery . relaxing with tempo and a bit of tantrum .
the self titled album from traffic is a great album and ranks amongst the finest albums off all time.highly recommended .
this is a great album but i still think the band messed up by not having ann b . davis on the cover wearing chains .
i never purchase this song i don't if no who this person i don't like listen to this type of music .

jay-z resonable doubt can't be compared 2 nas's illmatic . illmatic is better than resonable doubt . jay-z is a fake a * * thug n a comercial rappa .
this is jada's best album out of his trio . it seems more polished than the rest , maybe he had better instruction with jay rather than diddy

it's a shame they have ringo starr narrating this as he totally ruins it . does anyone know where can i get the original vesion without ringo ?
this album is a classic . omg the 90 ' s were just full of hip hop classics . mobb deep kills it on this record .
my kids love this song and that is why i downloaded it . they are very happy with the purchase . yay !
nice balance between new jack swing r & b and hip hop and dooo wopp like vocals . a big help at the time and was generally acceptable anywhere .
btnhresurrection is full of feel good tracks , it's one of my favorite bone thugs albums , but overall it's average .
the best double cd there is smooth beats and stuff u can sit back and smoke and drink to no filler songs jus good cd .

the doc should be called o . m . g . ( one man gang ) ... classic album period . no more said ...
i am a fan of this singer and was lucky to find this song as one of the discounted songs at one time
love this song , it's what every woman wants to hear from a man she's no longer with ! love bruno mars
dang this album is so good no joke . its one of his best i can honestly say its as good as his old stuff .
this is the live version of many of the classic , " the band " songs . they even have bob dylan join them for a few .
not a fan of ke $ ha , but am a huge fan of pitbull . i have to admit , i love this song ! ! !
terror spuad is terroring up the charts with lean back , streets of ny and bring ' em back . it gets 4 out of 5 .

i enjoy hearing celtic music . i was interested to see how the women would sing christmas songs . good as expected . recommend to family and friends .

love this band . they are simply fun , and smart . i may be their political opposite , but i love this band ! ! !

this is one of the best wings cd's to get . the song are great and it just flows , a must get cd .
also recommended by a friend and i really liked my first cd , so i purchased another one . she has a unique style and sound .
great return to their former glory ! get some pumkins and smash them into your head holes !
not exactly .. at all what i wanted to hear . guess i should pay closer attention to what's offered as free huh ?
i got this in vinyl when it was first produced . joan armatrading is a timeless classic . i promise if you buy this you will like it .
this is a cute little song that has a fun beat and i enjoy it as an add to my workout playlist .
most of the songs are quite catchy although i would not consider them as a rock act ( i've read that somewhere ) .
more new wave sounding , more synths , more melodic , sexy - their best album yet , beating the second album by miles .
not much to say about this classic but to say it's still as good as ever , albeit in a nostalgic way .
this band is really good . also recommended by a friend and i like their music , lyrics , sound , beat , and style .
i think this was a great song . i recommend it to everyone for next year's christmas song list . merry christmas !
trash , and irrated plus the good albums ya'll give them 0 ' s.so now i'ma let the world know .
this album really is a masterpiece . it has so much depth to it you've got to give it multiple listens .
i love tupac man ! ! best rapper ever ... no other will ever replace him .. do yourself a favour and buy this bomb cd now ! ! !
this is an amazing powerful vocal wether you watch the movie or not you will still love to her this girl sing .
d'angelo would be so awesome if he would wear clothes in his video . the album is awesome though !

this is a great album i listen to this when it first came out its hot if you don't got it get it .
wc is one of the best out of the west , but the shadiest one is and average album .

wasn't much of a chris brown fan to begin with , but i fell in love with the video and the song is very catchy .
rocko's best cd ever . he is my favorite rapper he killed it 4real . if u don't have this cd then go get it know ! ! !
great songs and brought back good memories from my college days . arrived promptly and in excellent condition !
easy to understand and listen to . i enjoyed their arrangement . i would like to listen to more of their music before referring anyone else .
loved this song before they started playing it 50 million times on the radio everyday . hope that this artist produces more great music in this vein .
i really like this song . that's why i bought it . chances are , you like it too ( if you are reading this ) .
this album brings back nice memories for me and it is always a pleasure to hear it . great re-issue .
awesome song , don't really care for adele but she did very well on this song , enough tht i bought it
this band blows and so does this album , the only half way good song is ' my way '
i cant find one good song on the whole thing , just ignore this record because it's wack.get me against the world though .
a must have for any holiday play list . this song takes a classic and gives it a acoustic feel to it .
as other people have noticed , this item is no longer copy protected . i still strongly recommend it .
very stratified with the item . good album from start to finish . quality production and hot tracks . bsb brought back the boyband fad with this one .
good band with those bass sounding vocals , own about 4 of their albums , definetly have their own sound , a solid effort
i love this whole album , some nice slow songs as well as some get angry tunes , the whole album is good
this was better than some that i listened to . was upbeat and you could understand it . liked the rythym of the music .
easy to hear and sounds good . i love it that i can only down load one song . thanks :-) sweet
this cd is the best cd in my rap collection and i got over 40 cds and im not even a big 2pac fan.enough said
i am a big fan of horrorcore . this albume is tight . i would also recomend tech n9ne if u like icp
i did not think too highly of this one , i am not too keen on slow music . good listening though .
aretha is still the queen . this cd is the bomb and she still got it . nuff said .
cute catchy song and lyrics . didn't like it at first but it got stuck in my head and now i'm a fan
not too much i can say except this will always be in my collection of her music . great lyrics . wonderful !
one of the most influential records on my life . one that stays in the mind and consciousness for years
hot , hot , hot ! 50 cent has competion from a second member of g-unit as the best member of the clique .
this debut is awesome , this is one of the best cds in the world , so awesome , this is a must have cd
i like the music but the lyrics are not so good . i wonder why they make this kind of stuff !
just a little to modern for my taste , he is a real artist somewhat under appreciated unlike the gold rush currently waz zup in the industry .
she will have u wanting every bit of music she has ever done . she did me and am i glad
really like this tune to this song , and like the words to this song . it's a song i like to hear over and over again ! !
" rock with you " , " don't stop till you get enough " and " she's out of my life " make this album ...
its time to let it go emie , you were never good in the first place .
we get to peek at marshall mathers though this album . many emotions and intense songs . this album will go down in history
this is the best album from sean " jay z " carter . nuff said .
first time i heard this song totally makes you want to groove along to it . great band ! would completely recommend !
we all know someone we want to see stand up and fight for themselves . this song is an anthem for those people .
this sometimes make me cry to listen to . i'm glad that i could add it to my collection . sometimes you need inspiration to be strong .
this is the song that clued me into avicii and so far i'm sold . i could listen to this one over and over , and sometimes i do .
point blank , one of the best albums ever in all aspects and if it didn't get 5 mics benzino was mad he can't make a better album .
i'm in a place in life right now . . this song fits in . . i love the message it puts out . .
another great work by the masters of funk . an essential for anyone who is serious about music . enjoy with all your funky soul
the worst rap album ever . same crap over and over from blueprint 2buy any 2pac album instead
great songwriting , singing . one of the best albums in recent years . performed by one of the most talented performers of recent years .
wonderful , unique sound ! this was purchased for my husband . he loved it then and loves it now ! this is a classic !
this song actually has well thought out lyrics that will motivate you . not just oh i'm gana win but with a thought out argument .
folk prog counterpart compatriots bring enough rustic ambition to stand out , if not fully convince .
ain't gonn explain why . it speaks for itself ! just hear the names guru & primo . and you can be sure about the quality .
what an amazing album , may very easily be the best of the steely dan catalogue
great cd , i really like it . good for just hanging out to .
this song always makes me wonder who she is singing about . katy perry is a very good singer . the other songs in this album are great also
this album is truly magic and eternal signiture of the greatest , genius music star : michael jackson . every song in this album is classic .
i love this song , it's so upbeat and says something positive instead of the usual trash your girlfriend , love bruno's voice
great song . along with hearing it on the radio i have heard this or parts of it played on tv shows sometimes without the singing .
just like the old days driving to the beach with the 8 track playing . takes be back to a nice place
i think bruno mars is a rising star and he will be very successful . he can take any beat and make it smooth .
quite a competent solo offering from page with an eye to the past.john miles sounds a lot better than plant here , he should have sung all the songs .
ice cube sucks . he soulda stayed with n . w . a and made another classic like " straight outta compton " and avoided making trash like this .
for those who are jd collectors or for those just discovering his music , this is one of those " must have " albums .
no superlatives can over-emphasize the impact this band had on me during my formative years ! fantastic music , great remastering , timeless groove ... funk at its best !
this song is a must have for rihanna fans . she is an amazing artist and this song is a must have !
i love katy's music , very well written song with sweet melody . always a good depth with each one . a must have
heard this on the way to a show the other day and was really taken by it ( long review forthcoming ) .
great album and probably a better one without " helen's wheels " , not one of mccartney's better singles . i'd love to hear those demos the mugger stole ...
amazon delivers on time and has items in stock ! love them ! and love the luther cd ! his music is everlasting !
i began looking for pieces of music to walk to and i found it with this song . i just love it .
the greatest rap album ever by the greatest rap artists ever . ranks up there with the bst in music history . r . i . p .
i can't say much for his singing but his songs will long be remembered . too bad art garfunkel isn't paired up with him any more .
this entire album is good so i bought the cd instead of just downloading a song or two via mp3
i practically wore out this cd . this is such great music and lyrics . if you don't have this album you are missing something .
it's not a favoriteblack man sings on guitar about remembering a girl when smelling orange blossomscan't relate to the lyrics
this cd is garbage ! to hell with lil wayne . that monkey deserves to be beaten to death by real rappers .
the g in g-code must stand for garbage ! the only songs worth listening to were u-understnd , g-code , da magnolia , and that fire.everything else sucked
off the wall is the highest achievement in michael's artistry . a very brilliant album with a very good remastered sound ! history begins with off the wall !
a purchase for my daughter she loves them for her ever growing music collection rhcp have been up anddown a good purchase
other than layla , there isn't much of interest here , just more british white boy blues , i'd stick to the comps .
could have used a better beat . singer sounds almost like she's inside of a phone booth or a very small bathroom singing .
i have heard all the albums and this is that i like the most , very complete and full of power ! ! !
the best song by the lumineers so far . it is a short song that has catchy tune . if you like the band fun . try this song .
i purchased this for one of faith evans songs . the other divas are my old school favorites that didnt make it in the industry .
cover their career and here it is ... would not say that these are all platinum hits , but maybe a titanium career with longevity
i used to have this on record . i was thrilled to finally find it on cd . this whole album is great .
cd has all the favorite classic sade tunes your used to . her current work doesnt have the classic sound she used to have but shes still wonderful !
great mix having bruno , snoop & wiz khalifa did a good song together they made an amazing collabo this is good
i can never forget how paul mc cathy sings the greatest songs of his greatest hit records from the 70 ' s . thanks , david
this is a excelente paul van dyk compilation , all the singles in music and video format , very nice package , i recommend ! ! !
this is my favorite romance cd . i'm not into toni's other cd's that much , but this one is hot .
this cd is awsome if you like this type of music . if you like this type of music buy it ! ! !
if you like rap from a real street point of view , than this cd is a must have . jeezy street s .. t is real .
she has the best voice and she always sings her songs so beautiful with pride and joy ... her greatest hits are the best to remember ..
not many songs are priced low but this song is . really love it to have purchased this it for a really price . like the song very much
in the same vein as the last radiohead album . thom yorke puts you into his head and then spins you around .
this was a free song and i like it when i first heard it . it has not been my favorite lyrics . but the tune is good .
great words great flow great beats great artist this album is amazing , his followup is horible , heres a thug for you , buy this now

i love blondie sooo needless to say this excited , and thrilled me to pieces especially when i didn't have to pay a dime ! :-)

excellent cd . such an emotional voice . definitely buy this . hear all samples at barnesandnoble
absolutely flawless album . this is what rock is all about . eddie van halen is uindeniably the best guitarist ever .
the great suburban showdown , roberta , los anginos are standouts , excellent remaster for it ; s age
lots of good songs , love the easy listening songs of jimmy buffett , great driving music , always a great beach feel
brought back some good memories and makes me sing along which makes me feel happy . highly recommended . still good after all these years .
even with all the controversy surrounding lauryn hill , this is a good album . good music is good music , its just that simple .
im happy that i got it , really good work , i didnt know they have so many good songs i only knew 2 or 3 .
pittbull is a really fun performer . his songs a usually really good . if you like pitbull , you should have this in your library . would recommend
i say that this particular album is very dear to me , after listening to the cd that replaced an eight track tape , i am very happy .
i'm not wild about this album but for anyone interested in alternative or " indie " music , " starlight " is a must listen , classic.matt zarnstorffzarnstorff
nfg is finally back and they put out one heck of an album . if you are a nfg fan don't hesitate , just pick it up .

love her she has a mind of her own and does what she wants , its great . she is a great performer and has great talent
this album is very goopd to have in cd rotation for any occasion you will not be able to stop listineing to the wonderful sounds of stevie wonder .
weird and wonderful ... as it should be . presence of a brain is priceless . very spooky . really great . i love it .
music is fun to listen to at this season and the free music as a neat way to meet new artists .
enjoyed listening to this sampler and looking for more from this type of music.been listening to it over and over .
good not as good as i know he can do but i like 90 % of all the tracks so i give it 4 1/2 stars
you wanna feel the godfather buy the box set which includes 80 hardcore jams made by jb and his disciples of funk .
this has to be one of the most requested moodies albums i have had the pleasure to listen to , it captures the essence of this brit pop band .
this is the album that brought female rap into the forefront . she was the first major female after salt-n-peppa . she's still the best .
this fake ass rapper album is a huge flop ! ! ! don't waste your money on this album .
this is one of the greatest albums of all time . listen to it on vinyl to get the full listening experience .
this cd is off the hook--just buy it . snoop has done it again .
what's better than a free song ? a good free song . i think people should download this free song today for a great track .
i enjoyed his stuff is great to listen to . this is for any fan of his and his albums and b sides .
oh why even bother wasting the energy to type ... it sucks , that is all you need to know .

i love aerosmith , especially their earlier works . i needed this one to complete the set of early works . it has many memories attached to these songs .
what a great cd ! i listen to it when i want to experience summer in the dead of winter . thanks jb .
aside from get your wings , this is their best effort-rock and roll at its finest .
darklands is really a terrific album , and the jesus & mary chain were one of the u . k's finest bands ever .
deep purple are a fantastic band and amongst my best.this super album contains anthems like burn and might just take your life.very very highly recommended .
the only song i'd put on a " jonsongs " sampler is " hurry home . "
this band plays some very solid hard rock.if you like drowning pool and disturbed you will like this music.good album
was not impressed with the different groups that was in this c . d . was dissappointed . todays groups just don't have what the older groups do .
really like this , love the cloud access for my music on the go , no need to store a disk anywhere .
glory will all way's be my number one song that cam made , also a must perchase ! ! !
i remember buying this record when i was 16 and thinking that it sounded really " grown up " and sophisticated . that's because it was . and is .
ok she plays the piano well but her lyrics are weird and equally sung as weird . the only track i liked was : silent all these years .
a stellar album . there's no " filler " here , as every track is strong , well played , and contributes to the overall album .
this song is ok . it is a slow thought provoking song . one i can use when i am in the mood to write or relax to .
dope cd , wc out did himself wit this one , unreal beats and lyrics , straight puttin ' it down from the wsc !
very infectious . the 24hoursofhappy website is very fun . i found it after purchasing this song . good song to workout too especially rollerblading !
swinging one of the songs that you cannot get out of your head once it is in there and easily a good back up to their first album .
i thought i liked his music , but maybe i didn't . his earlier stuff was much , much better . is he trying to mimic someone else now ?
this 16 track cd is a great collection of phil collins ' solo career greatest hits ! ! ! lots of phil ! ! ! a +
it's neat to hear how muse began . initially , they sounded similar to radiohead ( at their beginning too ) . but there are enough differences ...
this is a pretty good mccartneyalbum but there are very few rockersand it's mostly soft .. nothingspectacular .. but consistently good .
such a nice song . full of warmth , emotion , and beautifully sung . pity that john travolta will never find it in a web search :-(
here is a fun holiday tune done in a fun way ... what could be more lively than plucking a ukulele ? and a freebie from amazon . delightful !
i would not buy this song but , for free it is okay to have and listen to once or twice .
again with the christmas music . please know i did not order this . please reverse . i will not pay for items i do not want .
lauryn 2nd album , is not what you would expect . i am relieved and this is a blessing . truth and honesty and her voice is a godsend .
lauryn is a gifted artist and one of my favorite female mcs . this album is nothing short of a master piece .
2 1/2 overly cited indiecency that barely maintains any lasting intrigue past an important lead-off track .
the best songs from the greatest singer . play it all the time . bought copy for friend also . she loves it , too .
this has all the must have songs from joan baez's career , especially " diamonds & rust " , one of my favorites . get it .
great album , just not as many songs the i like that i had remembered . still i'm glad i purchased it . her classics are priceless .
it feels really nice to see that america can listen to a song that isn't in a language she generally speaks .
this guy is going to go far ... great cd .. i highly encourage you to buy this cd
a one hit wonder that became a classic song . brings back great memories . whats not to like and the price is great as well .
the album is toooooooooooooooooo pop and i just could not get in to it but i can see how others would like it
perfect album i bought the record and it's been on the player since . it's ear candy with vitamins for your thoughts .
i have this on cassette , that's how long ago this came out ! i love it and still play it often .
she is so talented & lovely ! ! don't count the things u do . do the things that count ! ! great listening to oldies .
the beat is ok , the music isn't bad , but i don't think this is the " blondie " that i know and love :)
at their best groups all across the globe ! one of the best singers in the galaxy ! it will give you the " chills " ! ! !
she just get's better and better . no more drama is my favorite song from 2001 . she heals and sooothes . what a great voice .
g-unit sucks but diz album is straight fire . 5 out of 5 4 - sho buck da world
john legend has done it again with a fantastic cd ! ! ! he has a varied and wide range of vocal skills ! he's awesome on this cd !

i liked this song right away when it came on and it was quite catchy so i decided to get here
i love this album especially numbers 2,3 , 4,6 , 7,8 , and number ---> 14 !
i like several songs on this cd , none of the others have particularly grown on me yet but that takes time .
i think this acoustic version is actually better than the studio version ... more emotional and stripped down without all of the over production .
i love this song ! it's such a catchy and upbeat song , you can't help but sing along ! definitely buy ! :)
origional songs from the recording studios always sound better then they do from collections such as the ' this is what i call music ' . sound is great !
i bought this song for my seven year old daughter . she loves it and listens to it repeatedly much to my chagrin .
sometimes you have just got to have a little blondie and this song is a fun one to listen to .
sly was and still is everything that funk needs . this timeless album is a must for everyone who likes up tempo music . such great tunes .
fairly good , just like the band . the cd does have all of the songs you love , plus a few others
led zeppelin was much much better ! i don't like this album at all ! this was a commecial album ! no good songs !
i was looking for some knew music and come across this album . the title struck me first places losers sounds funny if your first why did you lose .
the thompson twins made mediocre synth pop in a time when that was really cooool . now they just sound dated . valuable for nostalgia only .
this is another song from a few years ago that just had something catchy and addicting about it . fun song .
diana is so talented & beautiful ! kindness is 1 thing u cant give away - it always comes back ! ! !
amazing have had it for awhile but never got around to reviewing it , definitly worth buying
i love this album , it is my favorite album of all time , and thats all i have to say about it .
this is one of my favorite simon and garfunkel albums . if you don't own this , you should . it's a masterpiece .
sure he was important , but he still [ stinks ] . this album is rocky horror meets barbarella meets well , funk . f
3 1/2 though occasionally showing a nasty skeletal underside of hazy ramblings , pp is mostly an enthralling session of organically progressive ambiance .
the eurythmics is a dynamic duo that is very unique and have a with a great deal of talent to go with it .
the best cd you can buy.hands down best ever . r . i . p

even though i have never heard of nico vega , i decided to try this music . it is enjoyable to hear .
i gave this product four out of five stars because even though it has good songs on it , not all of them are good .

didn't like all the songs selected for this album but micheal still has it . takes you back to memory lane .
jay-z is the greatest and this album proves it.it ' s 90 times better than illmatic or stillmatic and nas ain't gonna never have it .
the only song worth listen to is nastradamus . i was very dissappointed by nas effort . his predictions was way off ! ! !
my dad wanted some music and this cd was one of them .. everything came in good condition n my dad rides around listening to it .. thanks
the eagles are one of those groups whose music you hear over and over . greatest hits packs a punch . great .
pun's lyrical skills are tight but the beats on this album don't quite stack up to the last one .
it was a real pleasure to listen to marc cohn.great voice , great lyrics , great set of songs .
in my opinion reasonable doubt is better , if not , as good as illmatic . i'll let other reviewers decide on this .
every single song on this album is great . a must own for classic rock / ' 70s pop fans .
i liked this because it is a fast song and i love very fast songs . so the more fast songs the better
this is an excellent collection of eurythmics music with excellent tracks . annie lennox and her partner , at their best . i would highly recommend this collection .
it's refreshing to see a " new " artist with talent . eric is on course and this cd proves it .
jackson browne / late for the sky : excellent and entertaining album . it's always a joy to put this one on . five stars .
this was a good song . if you like the artist's other music , i don't see why you wouldn't like this song .

one of my very favorites , when vinyl was it . i'm so glad to ad it now to my digital collection .

the cars were great.rick ocasek is a classis rocker and this set of songs is awesome !
i was afraid this band was going to be a one-hit wonder , but they're proven their versatility . love the lyrics and orchestra .
i like this album its stevie wonder what else do you expect ... you get what you pay for it i love it though

alan parsons is an acquired taste for many . the album is great for a night of relaxing alone , or with friends .
all their mindless , greed rhyming , repetitive music placed in one album.this should kill some braincells if you want to torture some people .

vulture culture says it all . great sounds . don't know why they disbanded , but have such a blend of voices and talent .
great cd , very poiltically incorrect i love it . i had tyhe tape but needed the disc
another great work from an awesome band . if you are considering buying this you know what i mean .
the operative word here is " derivative . " their name is appropriate because they certainly " tap " the " roots " of bands that went before them .
i wish kenny rogers would just mail this guy a rhino turd ! can't believe this stuff sells ! anything endorsed by simon cowell is just lame !

this a great cd . dance , dance , dance . thank you cyndi for such a great cd . you bring me to the brink !
when you're in a barrack , there is a lot of different types of music floating through the air , fell in love with this group .
why does she keep holding on to this album ? is it because it was her only bestseller ?
if something is fantastic then it is just fantastic . track after track the album takes your breath away . i can't find anymore words to describe it .
i rediscovered this album about a month ago and i love it ! it is really good ... and really right beside you alone is worth it .
stormwind , screams of anger and the title tracks are my favorites tracks on a classic 80s album that still holds up today . europe's second album .

nasty cd ludas mad funny . hip hop quotables one of the best songs ive ever herd . want somethin different get this .
d tones make classic music . they are classic guys . just straight forward . we need that in society . rock n role music at it's best
enjoyable early 60 ' s hard bop with a considerable amount of rawness injected from this particular lineup still usually walks the line between authentic and generic composition-wise .
i have listened to the full release and say great job whitney and clive ! ! ! it is real ! ! !
another masterpiece by the m . b . ' s . from start to finish a fine work that must be in any collection of their's .
i remember playing this over and over , it was the first music album i ever bought . ..
all of his hits are here and great b-sides.the only problem with this disc is that the songs are edited to much.they should be played in there full zenith .
including the hit song ' around the world ' this album came out for my graduation from art and design school in 1996 .

great song with original and great tune and lyrics ! cheerful lyrics and upbeat tune . really fun to listen to . love it !
good side bad side was a way better album.this cd final tic is a classic it's worth buying .
this song is not everyone's cup of tea . i liked it . the beat was engaging , and lyrics were not very dirty .
this cd has it all , i am surprised noone has mentioned " it ain't easy " , a smooth song with a great beat .
of monsters and men has some of the best song i've heard in awhile . i would buy this again for a friend .
listened but can say that it is ok . good to hear from the time again but a little disappointed . hard to duplicate the original sound
i have always enjoyed listening to it specially during karaoke , people sing it very well so i figured why not own it .
i listen to this album when i was young . i dance to the music just not professionally . i dance maybe sing in the shower .
hallelujah ! something a little more unusual for a christmas song . and carole king is singing - good stuff ! thanks for the free christmas song , amazon !

kelly is the greatest ! i love her music , will buy whatever she sings because she has such a beautiful voice .
this is just the version of this song i was looking for i was so happy to get it at the price i did as well
this is hot but it is not like cubian linx he doesn't even have ghostface on the album i like this tight .
who doesn't like flogging molly ? great song ! and now it's on my cloud where i can access it any time .
the song is beautiful . the video to this is amazing , the song is great , and the singer is great . beautiful !
not actually to bad , even for free . i would pay for this in a heart beat if i had to . :-)
i like all the tracks on this album , but my favorite it track one , al no corrida . classic quincy jones .
how can you not like this album . the melodies stick in youre head all day long . any thing new order rules .
i don't care for miley's behavior but i couldn't help but love the song . she has a great voice and a lot of talent .
what's not to like ? ? i first heard this tune while on a cruise . i knew i had to have it . i was not disappointed .
none of them can rap at all , my grandma could rap better , and those beats suck , how can you like dem franchise boyz ?
like most of the songs . love her voice . so sensual and sexy . would love to have seen some of my other faves on this compilation .
a great band who knows how to rock hard . with this collection being very slow and melodic i believe that it shows the softer side of the group .
dusty was great soul singer hidden inside a white british pop queen until she went down to memphis to record this album . this one made her a star
i realy dig rooney . it is just sweet melodic music . have a beachboys mixed with the cars sound . i realy like it .

nice soft relaxing music , song . i like the way this song is done . very nice . nice boost for the holidays !
this is such a unique sound ! i love it ! i never tire of listening to this ! this is a must !
not as awesome as their first album . this one sounded much more country . almost the left-overs of the first album .

this isn't their best work , but the whispers haven't made a bad one yet . the slow jams here are working .
i really enjoyed listening to this song , i would suggest listening to this song . i'm getting this artist other songs also .
easily listening and great vocals . the auto-rip feature on select albums saves a lot of time , though it does give you an additional review to post .
so simple.the buildup.the repetition.the layers.the deeper meanings in my life.it gets me going and excited . i love it .
lauper's version of this classic christmas track is well done.perhaps it's not the most versatile , or passionate version out therebut still ~ it's very good ,

this song is awesome . chrisitina has a beautiful voice and the words are perfect . you can't go wrong with this one .
the rell joint is phenomenal ... jay z massacred everything he touched . yet ... everything submitted after siw makes the soundtrack sort of average ...
maybe lauryn shouldve worried more about how bad her voice sounds than playing guitar at the level of an 8 year old .
i like the concept of the album , clashing personalities and an internal struggle . he pulled it off nicely too , definitly check this album out .
another outstanding album created by the great gordon lightfoot . this cd is filled with thoroughly enjoyable music . i am constantly returning to listen to this great work .

album - generic flipper well , what's to say , it's flipper . you're either going to hate them or hate them . yeah , that's clean .
this cd adheres to the artsy yet austere garage twang , trad mariachi and drifting experimental lounge jazz found on calexico's previous albums .
this almost seems to be drawn from einstein's worst fear . the triumph of technology over the human senses . you can't make this stuff up .
i am advancing to the rear , going back in time to listen to music that makes me smile and not injure my ears .
when vinyl albums almost became obsolete i really missed listening to elton john , so happy to have this again in my music collection .

if you enjoyed their first album , pretenders ii will not disappoint ! there's no sophomore slump here . for any pretenders fan , this is a must have !
toni braxton is one of the best . her voice is unmatched . this is the kind of stuff you light candles too .

good album from one of the more prominent old school rappers , who is still around .
this is the only song i like by this group but its a good one . i hope they come out with some more similar to this one .
best christian screamo record ever ! it also contains the most religion as far as lyrics , and doesn't ever move away from talking about jesus or christianity .
just another run of the mill teenager depressing whine feat from aic . sucked then sucks now nothing special move on ... , .
i had this album in lp form and it is the best album by the artist . it's still as great as i remembered
this is a great cd for anyone ! great to give as a gift or purchase for yourself to listen to over and over !
this got me to throw away my johnny cougar and eagles albums and into rock with a folk / country feel . this is his best in my opinion .
you can still bounce to this ! ! ! or relax to this ... try this one out .
i had this album years ago and always been an eagles fan so i wanted to get the cd of it .
i bought this because ' bloom ' was so magical . i was not disapointed . soooo glad this album has become part of my life .
i expected their greatest album ever , and instead got a somewhat decent album . these guys really need to kick it up a notch .
honestly , i think i got this one for free , and as a music lover who also loves a good deal , free was the right price !
under rug swept and beyond alanis sucks . before under rug she was awesome . this new album sounds like avril ... shameful ! ! !
i was afraid that old dirty was going off the deep end , but i didn't expecty him to go this far off ..
omg such a great voice so sexy and such a great song this is the song you hope everyone of your ex's sing in their head after you break up
i read that this was album voted number one for 2012 so i bought it . it does not disappoint . the sound is amazing .
bought this for my daughter who loves this group . it's a great collection of their music and i enjoy it , too .
this album was horrible . if it wasn't for the " anything " track by jay-z this album probably wouldn't have sold .
this is emmylou harris at her very best . there isn't a bad track on the album .
i have this on cd and mistakenly ordered it from amazon cloud i guess-i don't need it three times ! please reverse i will not pay !
thank you amazon.com for letting me record and download music from this great gaelic music cd it was well woth the effort thanks to the amazon.com cloud player
this album was good but shyne needs to come out wit an album dat has more tracks on it .
i chose this song because i love the words of the song and this song goes along with my personality and i feel like dancing , too .
i really enjoyed listening to this song , i would suggest listening to this song . i'm getting other songs by this artist .
what moron calls this pop ? pop is backstreet boysthis is rock n roll with humor and its greatthey entire band is talented.and moron , led zeppelin was blues .
song for the interested . it has a decent rhythm and a good beat . it it a song that you need to listen to decide on purchase .
didn't bond that much with this guy , perhaps a little soft for mytastes , just didn't replay it alot , and have not listened in months
just like the old days of driving to the beach with the 8 track playing . takes me back to a nice place
whether or not a cat stevens follower , this cd is delightfully mixed of some songs not often heard by him . i love all of his music !
you will learn and sing the songs that are on this record , buy it !
this album is brilliant and the coverart is fantastic ! i love the music and the look and feel of this album .
unfortunately , i only got to listen this cd partially , but what i heard was good . will surely listen more and it is on my truck list .
this is a great cd by expose one of their best along with exposure . i highly recommend it for old and new expose fans !
no one singer dominates any song , though i think linda has the superior voice . and their harmonies are excellent.emily lou harris is demure as usual .
mariah has that voice you can't copy , all the music are her hits so its worth the money a + music
i like pharrell williams and really like this one . i love the beat and i like to dance so this one makes me want to dance .
they have continued on from the english beat tradition.everything on here is super well performed , it can only be the changing of an era ...
alabama shakes is on this sampler and they're become pretty big these days so scoing one of their songs for free , i think is a sweet deal .
i like it . played it several times since downloading . life is beautiful = good music to sing along with in the car .
the is a good folksy cd with a number of good songs . great harmonies and lyrics . my first try of this band and i wound buy more
for her fans this is terrific . great voice , great songs and you will enjoy immensely . also for gifts to friends
i have heard this song on the radio and not that long ago i hear this song on a tv show .
and definitely not my last . came to porcupine tree via steven wilson's great 2013 album and will not stop here . love it .
this is perfection . if you really like music ( be it classic , metal , jazz , hardcore , rap , whatever ) you'll love this one .
love this song , love this movie love disney and all it is , so happy to have this on my music device
this is just awful . words can not express how much i hate this man and his " music " . not worth your time or money .
i accidentally downloaded this song twice , which sucks . the song is great , but i wish amazon would do something more about notifying customers about double purchases .
you can't go wrong with a cold play song . they have music that is un-comparable to other groups . good song
this is cute dance music from gay twins . not that the gender matters , this cd really makes no political statements .
diana shows she still has that terrific voice . some catchy tunes , and some good vocals from diana . i would recommend this cd !
an oldie but a goodie . this is classic diana ross . there are too many favorites to mention . couldnt ' get better .
this one is a great one to get if you like her bed time stores album . this is for any fan of hers .
nice album by george benson that is smooth sounding and allows one to lean back , relax , get into the rhythm and flow away
i was hoping for more on this album and it seem i really only liked the safe and sound song
jay is the illest , what got me on this album was so ghetto it was a classic and i dont care what the world thinks
i really enjoyed this ! love holiday music and would recommend it to friends , family and others , great sounding easy listening and very clear !
hadn't heard it before and when i did i liked it ... i've always liked blondie and their hits since day one .
i love this song and pl ; ay it all the time , amazon is the only place i get my music ! ! !
i don't have any more to write about this piece of trash.this isn't hip hop , this is a disgrace .
some new-new classic southern hip hop ... jus press play and let it ride on out yall ...
if you can get past his anoying chant of we da best every song then it's dope !
it was great hearing his voices in different music and movies . collins is still the greatest music writer . thanks phll
this was ok but not something i really would spend a lot of money on . it could have been much better .
fun is a good band , and they have some really great songs ; especially this one . i would definitely get this
mary is my girl . this cd is a must have . i love it .
makes you wonder why they broke up the duo when they could make such beautiful music together . the harmonies art garfunkle lends to the music are priceless !
my daughter got me to listen to this . i wanted to own it and how i do . it is fun
this song is on the rage and well we just had to add it to the playlist . it uploaded very nicely and plays well . must have .
surprisingly , i'm feeling juelz . i'm not your typical hip hop fan , but not bad . definitely 4 stars .
in the case of hot buttered soul , less is truly more.and the remastered quality is awesome ! great price , you can't beat it .
takes me back to thos hot summer days driving to the beach listening to jb on the 8 track yeah ! ! !
eclectic and slow , but funky and fun.definately buy this if you like pink floyd - piper at the gates of dawn
i love this entire cd , i love this entire cd . what more can i say .
nice and mellow beats this time none of that loud , and to smahed sound .
this song good and i got it free . if you get the chance take a listen , you may like it .

soemwhere between good and ho hum . sorry . i wanted to liek this but it is just run of the mill .
excellent ! i love this cd because , he had 2 but , i have one for all ! great music for everybody , i said !
allison krauss has a really amazing voice and sound . good band . easy listening , easy humming and easy to sing along .
regardless of what you think about her actions lately . miley cyrus can sing ! she's not a kid anymore and she wants everyone to know it ! !
beautiful vocals , the music is so wonderfully written . had only heard the single pompeii but the rest of the album is equally strong . love this album !
this is a almost new cd by a guy whose been putting out some great music for a long time . and i like it ! ! !
all hail this paris duo . they lost their way after this but homeworkis izmo the best dance album ever . underworld and homework is all u need .
moderately enduring trip-hop which prides itself on accessible diversity is a well deserved hit , if slightly consistent in providing less than breathtaking competence .
i have alway's liked this guy's music.he has a great voice.every song is good on this recording . i think it is his best one yet .
i started collecting his cd's recently and now i'm a huge fan ! i love that he can go from ballad to blues to any other style seamlessly !
i love all these new artist on amazonplies song with the dream is hotand tiec tocc's frozen song i loveand the dreams & jamie foxx blame itgreat music
why do people all diss on ashanti ? i am not a big fan , but i think this is a nice cd go pick on britney spears
not a fan of the new sound . they used to be the second coming of the pogues , now they sound like many bands .
great music ... so happy to add this to my library . have always enjoyed the music from simon & garfunkel ... great harmony , great singing voices .
this song is catchy , i don't understand the explicit part except for the first few seconds where he swears which is dumb and unnecessary .
the title track is good and fopp is a heavy rocking classic and smoking , and can't 4get the sweet sticky thing pure funkjazz love this 2disday .
this is by far there best work . they were more creative sounding on this album . stand out songs the hurting , change .
this is a happy tune . i can almost smell the orange blossoms every time that i play it .. nice job .
love this cd . good all the way through . so glad there are still some real singers who sing real music out here .
if you like to rawk you will love this album as it does indeed rawk most mightily verily thus . if you don't , you won't .
another mix of fun and greatness from the athenian clan ! thank you for this lp ! ! !
dmx is an animal abuser . don't buy this album and boycott def jam records until they stop glamorizing dog fighting with albums like this .
this album is called the gift and the curse but the whole thing is a gift in my book . amazing album .
this song is fun to listen to , the lyrics are a little gloomy but i don't mind it's mostly about marriage and devotion .
wishing on a star , ooh boy and do your dance ( my favorite ) make this album a 1970 ' s soul classic ! ! !

i like this album , not as much as liquid swords but there are some really dope cuts on this record too .
i have this song on instant replay - this is my wake up driving to work song . i'm friends with the monster !
i love the catalyst . beyond that , i feel like this album requires a little more intensive listening to get into it .
mystical , psychedelic rock perfection transmuted through a genius who was here for only so long , but left a profound , everlasting art .
steely dan is so awesome , there has never been such an orginal group.this is a classic set of music .
the song and video are impressive and well done , it's the lip-dubs that really show the beauty of the songget the song and album then watch the videos

and i repeat , fantastic and fun ! ps . track 8 is a little difficult to enjoy .
rickie lee jones album is still relevant after all these years . her style should be studied by present female vocalists looking to do a lot with less .

absolutely the best of the best with astonishing digital remaster grab it now .. i love it ! ! !
electronica . the music is well done , but the voices and their intonations are weird . it's still a lot of fun .

this is the old fantasia , that i loved . she was timid but strong and that's why i gave her five stars .
keisha is a total package.forgive me for overstating her but this album is the bomb.the only problem is that she bashes dudes one 2 many times on her songs
coheed and cambria's neverending saga set to prog-rock music that sounds more and more like rush gets more and more annoying each album .
this cd is the bomb biggidy . every single track from start to finish is amazing . this cd is definitly worth buying

great cd with all of her classic songs that brings back memories of a never-forgotten era.enjoyed this ! will not disappoint .
this album has catchy songs with great lyrics . i especially love stars . grace has a great voice . not a bad song in the bunch
it's refreshing to hear a singer / songwriter succeed as she has . but it's only average to me . good but not great .

this is another super fun and greatly unique album . this and the first album are rock classics with their own special appeal . the b's rock .
yet another classic that only became popular because their audience was stoned . blaring , muddy , unmusical crud .

i live about 30 mins from athens . i however didn't discover them until they made it to sirius . they are amazing ! the album is beautiful .

i'm not a big pop music listener . but i know what's good , and this cd is .
this song will move you to want to sing even if your not religious.she has a voice that makes you want to sing along .
despicable lyrics promoting drugs and denigrating police destroy otherwise noteworthy and engaging rock music .

it's nice to be able to hear this anytime i like and is perfect for working out . great sound quality !
one of the best albums of the last 20 years , and i have listened to alot of albums
lyrics is off the chain and the dark beats fits the rhymes like a glove ... nobody can call this commercial thats for damn sure ... it's great !
ok cd . has to many annoying party joints on it , and ' crush tonight ' is becoming annoying . better off getting the new nas cd .
good song , i feel like david guetta just drafts singers because his voice is terrible or he doesn't like it and think other's are better . thoughts ?
1,2 stars . are you on crack , this cd and movie is a classic . every song is good , no bs .
a line which perhaps sums up this album : " i can see the tunnel at the end of all these lights ... "

this is a well-written folk song about the real meaning of christmas - - a nice change of pace for the holidays .
classical music puts me to sleep , this is an exceptionally inexpensive group of wonderful music to relax to and fall asleep with , such a great deal !
this reminds me of flaming lips " hit to death in the future head " . it's sonic , rockin , catchy , trippy , and flows together nicely .

ti is real ya heard me he is like my favorite rapper b . g . come he come street and gangsta
this song should be a classic among pop songs . vocal ranges go from low to high with a driving beat , coupled with lady gaga's sweet voice .
the artist has a good enough voice , but the song isn't very unique . i would listen to this as background music .
good music.soulful , relaxing.classic barry.good oldie , but goodie that never goes out of style.good price too ! i got it on my mp3 player !
very good song . it is nice and relaxing . has no words to it just music . great for a dinner party .
the beat , tiara on the chorus & wale's voice are soo well put together love it sooo much . great song

my daughter absolutely loves this song she listens to it all of the time thats all i can really say about this song
" video killed ... " sounds like the 15 year old tracy merop singing in the song
it was just nice to hear music that takes you back to memories when times were not complicated . just good music
there is nothing redeemable about their latest endeavour . don't waste your money . they've become a ... mellow adult contempo band.ew .
this is storytelling at its finest from beginning to end . i think this is jay-z's 3rd finest album behind reasonable doubt and blueprint 1
delivery blyrics a + production a + style a + heart a + overall a
has that garage / grunge band sound . just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s i have collected , and forgettable . nice cover though .

i played this one to death . i like train . give it a listen . i'm pretty sure you will nto be disappointed .
this in my opinion is not one of pac's better cd's . this one is cool but he's had way better , but i still love him .
all of her best hits in one place ! i esspecially like the remixes of say a prayer and i'll wait .
3 1/2 high quality warm-up material here not to be dismissed is on par with some of his overpraised conceptual works further down the era .
what a great way to introduce people to steely dan . one of their best releases .
i have to agree that any chick who willingly portrays herself as a wild motorcycle ride knows what a guy wants . thats some fast rumbling .
bought this song for my daughter and she loves it and would recommend it to all of her friends.cute song
i will alway treasure the moment i bought this song from your website because it is awesome thank you so much amazon
i bought the book first and later bought the album is a greatcd & book to have because it showed how pac really was like.you won't be sorry

one of their best i liked the superbowl performance and it is a twist to a classic song give it a try you might like it
i have always been entertained by nicki minaj's songs even this one . try her other song super bass and you might like it .
i picked up the cd for the song " all star " . it was okay for about a week , then it got annoying .
nice collection of oldies to listen to . also a very beautiful lady , with a very sweet voice . helps me remember better times .
where are the two more well sung and strongests songs by cat stevens , the hurt and later from the foreigner - 1973 ? ? ?

this compilation is missing two of his biggest hits " hard to handle " and " love man " other wise it is a pretty good retrospective .
classic joy division , i own this on vinyl and it is a classic from joy division along with closer.if you do not own thispick it up ! ! !
bruno is already in heacy rotation on my playlist but this song just does something to me . it's mournful , soulful and proud . awecome combination .
a lot of people didn't know about this cd when it came out . this was and still is a great buy . the singing is ( priceless ) ...

this album is a great retrospective of a well respected musical family . all the songs we remember and all together .
3 1/2 a startlingly diverse production adeptness ensures this release has not aged nearly as fast as similarly dated electronic material .
this guy has terrible vocals , like a dying goat with a new york accent . this is garbage .
i enjoyed there cars , candyo , this one , hart break city , shake it up , door to door , movie like this and there anthology albums .
" banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow . " thats all i gotta say , this cd is hot , cop it .
greatest album ever from chamillionaire . he is the best rapper in the south . if you do not have this album then go get it now ! ! !
you don't hear neil sedaka's name too much anymore . hopefully this record will give a different generation a chance to appreciate this wonderful composer and singer's talent .
wow is all i can say ! this is one of the best rock albums ive hear in a long time ! !
i got this album because i liked carl . he didn't disappoint me . his album is inspiring and recommend it to everyone .
they sing and play about peace and love ! why ? that's terrible ! i don't like the vocals either !
yes she can sing but i am not that impressed to actually purchase the album .
this is old school singing . but it was what you call singing . these women were phenomenal and they got their message across through song .
i'm still amazed at jimi's sound and what he does with a guitar . this won't disappoint you if you've even listed to his music .
clay's album is a very good cd to listen to.it is very relax full and enjoyable.anybody who like clay will like his album .
this is a good song , but i can't say my favorite , or my favorite by the kings . they are super talented , though ...
that the kids downloaded with some of my free downloads that i got when i ordered good music . i'm sure this sucks as it's coldplay .
even if it's not historically accurate , the story of three kings visiting the christ child is beautiful . this song is also beautiful .
i bough this to use as background music for a multi media presentation i am having to create , and it is perfect !
great music ! this cd was even better than i expected . i was very impressed ! perfect gift or just to have yourself !
only one word can describe this album - - atrocious . jeff buckley ? ? ha--more like jeff suckley .
it remind me of pop , meets , rock , meets new age , meets all in it's own . a nice song for the buck
but enough of this manufactured pop garbage already ! who in tarnation is iggy ass-water ? ? disney pumps out the manufactured bubble gum pablum at a breakneck pace .
still one of the high water marks of old-school ( ie : integrity-possessed ) hip hop , both lyrically and sonically .
i really enjoyed this one and felt lucky to hit on it especially in the free download list . probably a good future here .
greatest rock band from sweden ever in the entire universe for all time and for ever and ever and ever .
not my favorite album of theirs but still awesome ! ! a must have for any simon and garfunkel fan . this is just my opinion of course .
rate this 1.5 stars . my way and rollin'are improvements over prievious limp bizkit hits like faith , and nookie , but this band still blows .
as any otis redding fan will tell you he gives you 100 % . well he did it again in this album .
purchased this song specifically to add to my exercise playlist , as i need something real up-tempo to get and keep my workout going .
go to mike " michael " s review . this kid is stupid . i guarantee his review will make you laugh .
my boyfriend got me hooked on this song . has good lyrics with good sounds ! hope this artist comes out with more hits .
acquired solely to duplicate my vinyls-to-digital collection , but a " must have " for mj collections ( before all the contraversy ) . blah , blah .
what a great guy's song . i am surprised that the politically correct denver recorded it but i will always respect him for it .
love my buffett , i can listen to his music all day long , i just shuffle it around and let it go again
how can you not like devo . the funnest quirky new wave act . this is a great collection of there songs . i like it alot .
another great cd by elton john--love his music and lyrics , his voice , and this cd has a great selection of songs if you love sir elton .
this is mark's best album since dire straits - and contains his best song of all time ever - love and happiness . gorgeous ! ! !
ohio players are underrated as funksters , but their legacy carries on ... listen to fire on hell's kitchen ; great sound and funk ... enjoy and dance .
very good song , catchy rhythm . truth spoken again from the lovely katy perry . there's not many things of hers that are unlikable
acquired solely to duplicate my vinyls-to-digital collection . it was " required " party music of 1975 , though i still like what chaka has done since then .
not bad . better than previous albums . definately better than " 36 chambers " . not a bad buy .
tourist history was better as a whole but many of the songs on beacon are better than most of tourist history .
love this song . whenever i hear it i have to turn my stereo way up bump . this song really gets me pumped up .
but really not a classic , of course it has standout songs but it is just another album
i'm accustomed to a more beautiful version ; this one is scratchy , though sincere . the artist might be more successful singing more softly and melodiously .
loved the songs ! ! she has a really good voice . a must have if you like d . h . t or dance-pop kind of music .
i love this album and it's good to hear the old sounds . i am replacing a vinyl album from 40 plus years ago .
upbeat party collaboration leaves one wanting , hardly providing anything involving besides a few occasional choruses that catch .
another pop and country duo love this song alot when she teams up with a country artist it is magical a must have
this is really good music . my favorite one is serve the ego . i can listen to it all day .
g-funk from the bay e-fizze rep that bay life the beats are bangin the lyrics are dope they slam on my jbl's makin heads turn
yes , it really is that good ... just check out the other reviews here
come on this is one of his best albums to me . i mean they're a couple joints that i dont care for but i like 90 % of it
r.i.p.the juliana theoryone of the finest bands to hit the scene.thank you for the music , the inspiration , and the love .
the album wasn't full of hits , but there's plenty to like . kodachrome by itself is almost worth the price of the cd .
another one of my favorite's in my cd collection . no skipping tracks on this one .
a very nice change of pace for christmas music . this is one that is gentle on the ears and brings back memories from years gone past !
the music is ok . it has a nice enough beat to it , but i don't thinks it's . i don't think it's debra harry
sub pop 2013 : first place losers is an acclectatic mix of music that kept me interested in listening to more . i would definitely recommend this album
this album is good but not the same without that 50 influence ... buck is very talented and deserves his props though .
blue oyster cult has always been one of my favorite rock bands and " the reaper " was one of their best songs .
this doesn't even scratch the surface of their great stuff . you can make a greatest hits just from their first two albums . rated low for content .
i love this early prince stuff ... it's almost still disco music but you can tell it was composed by a genius .
i love everything maroon 5 has done . their musicality is exceptional . fantastic lyrics .
_though a gbv completist , i recommend on musical merits - - this is a good one .
this one is a good one to get if you like his early stuff and like his music and albums .
one of the first " white rappers " to take it to the next plane of existence ! no cursing to get their point across ! !
great song for parties and such events . pretty cool to get a whole group together to dance to the song .
i've been listening to aerosmith since the early 80 ' s.this album truly has the classics on it . i rate this cd a 5 of 5 stars ! !
el producto es muy bueno . el vendedor muy amable.se recomienda este vendedordisculpas por no escribir en ingles.soy de argentina.saludos .
great dancing song i love it and dont think i will ever get tired of it and i dont really like most of her stuff
get this cd if you like the ' bats ! " super rad " is their theme song , and the rest are good .
for the inordinately curious.the grant green album is far superior to the donald byrd session , which isn't saying a whole lot .
she is a very talented artist and she always seems to know what to write . like this song lots
alison krauss has one of the most beautiful voice . her band is really good too . easy listening . easy to hum or sing along .
ted's at his best live and outragous.growing up in the 70 ' s this was one of the live albums you could not be caught without .
first album put out by the group . the first three songs are great , but the album goes downhill from there .
i love bruno - he's so much fun and this song is a nice one . it's a great addition to anyone's music library .
this is a great cd . it has some great rockers on it , " question " being my all time favorite . it belongs in your music library .
again more artist that come out with commercialized crap ! don't buy this stuff people get real music !
i wouldn't recoommend itnot my fav . song and the voice is good but the song choice was not good.hard to follow . not a traditional version to me .
this when juve returned to cash money and showed why he , was the best they had . this is what prompted wayne to go harder for the label .
not one of steely dan's best but still a good one to have in your collection if you're a collector of steely dan .
jay z one of the greats hommie , just like i tell others you already know this ' .
this song was played a lot during the summer and just reminds me of all the good times i had
paul simon music is great ! ! ! his the white man with the black music . for years paul has shown his true colors .
very good . i love music by paramore . i was watching american idol and heard a contestant sing the song . love it !
just keep on saying the rapture is a " great band , " and continue ignoring the fact that they suck * ss ... royally ...
this shows how good new music can be . a strong blend of style and political substance that has what i like in all enduring musical performances .
this album is better in every way than oracular spectacular . good to see mgmt making the music they want to this time .
they took us back . their music is a rare find along with their voices . this is a must have for your collection
music of christmas brought back childhood memories great to collect and start a nice collection for the holidays cheers ... enjoy this album great to order for gifts ..
actually had a problem downloading so many songs at oncenever heard itcan't review itthis looked good too
this album doesn't stop from the first track to the last you are caught in the godfather's jungle groove . a must for any music fan ! ! !
we made our own dance cd and this was one of the songs we used . keeps us moving ! great exercise .
gr8 group ! love the music and the songs ! breakout group of the last several years in our opinion ! great album !
actually , 10 stars ! the cd was better than the original album and worth twice the selling price . we miss you jimi !
and i am not the biggest hip hop fan , ok ? but lauryn has a beautiful voice , and it came out fabulously on this album .
i give everything a fair shot and i was curious about this kid but this is just trash ! i wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy .
you have great jazz work , lyrical work , and good hardcore tracks what else could you want ? if your new to this then pick this up .
7 to 9 winners found here , although i can't say any of them is really a classic . but it's great fun for a season or two !
i just recently started hearing this group on the radio and i think this song is good enough . 2 more .
this group is derivative and dull . the songs on this album get annoying very quick ( not to mention played out ) .
again , i've always like the hits of blondie ... i heard this song , i liked it and so i bought it to add to my collection .
this is a classic punk tune and well worth the money and time to download . the femmes were great and this is a great song .
this sounds like the smiths covering " odessey & oracle " . hooks , hooks , hooks .
i must say an improvement a tight album all i can say must buy album . dont sleep on it the same for ll cool j new album exit 13
trae really killed it with this album . one of the best so far this year
my all-time favorite mccartney album.it rates right up there with abbey road and other beatle classics.another great add to my cd collection
different music very little singing kids like dancing or spinning to the fast and slow beats of the music . yet is also soothing .
this album crunk.the best album bad boy put out.biggie is one of the top rappers ever.if you pick no other album pick this oneup .
i love this song because it is very inspirational ! i first heard this song in dance class and knew had to buy it from amazon .
yall are some cot damn haters . this cd is on point , my fav . released this year . dont sleep , pick this up .
the follow up was excellent ! the production was " the bomb " , hardly any production team was any better i'm sure of that !
i'm not a p & b kind of guy but davis's contribution to the overly-covered material still swings hard enough to stand out in earlier , less adventurous phases .
sade is classic i have most of her albums ... hip hop katz .. expand your minds pick up sade .
i hard this song on the radio and was instantly hooked on it . this is the perfect version to get me to get out and move more
great disc.love the lead singer.he sounds like a cross of robert plant and billy squire ! bonham and the rest of the band are fantastic !
this was a good album that listens well from beginning to end . i bought it for voices carry but many other songs were memorable .
lil wayne has better talent than this . i recommend the new afroman disc . every beat be banging hard . join the streetteam on his website .
he had alot to say.he had alot of nothing to say.we ' ll miss him .
this is one of the few modern songs that i really enjoy . great beat and good lyrics .
from joe sample . joe is a living legend and this solo project is my favorite .
while there is not much meat on the bones here , lyrically speaking , there is an infectious hook you can't get out of your mind .
this album isn't great , and she always sounds the same through different songs . i do like the song she made a tribute to janis though .
machinehead is most certainly the greatest deep purple album and contains my favourite songs in highway star , space truckin and smoke on the water.very very highly recommended .
diane birch , unbelievable young artist . she her now or it will cost you hundreds in a year to see her . cd tops it all
it was a gift for his brother that uses to listen to cat stevens , but love that it was on a cd .
if you smoke this cd will make u zone out like your in a different galaxy .
a stunning display of commanding musicianship , impeccablesongwriting , and insurmountable beauty that recalls this eraof creativity
love the classic 80s jams ... phil ... genesis . before or after ... i am a fan ! gotta have that music to reminisce from .
the prominant drum work and harmonies make this a very interesting number , almost evoking some early queen ones or some def leppard
pioneers . without this album none of that thug sh * * you listen to would ever have existed ... eazy-e r . i . p .
lyrics - ice cube , mc renproduction - dr . dre , dj yellaprofit - eazy-e
i purchased hot n cold as an mp3 download , and i am very pleased with how good it sounds . i really enjoy it !
this has some good songs but atleast it was back when cam was fast and not a slow rapper cop it
this is good listening music for the young ; dancing too i guess . too young for me but i still recommend it .
damn that's funny . this cd is garbage . there is only two tight songs on the whole album .
50 , lloyd banks , tony yayo and young buck show up for another gunit classic . gunit is my favorite hip-hop / rap group
great work ! i love this album . this boy is great with his music . i will be buying his second album as well .
... to listen to and buy this bs . i'm not a ca $ h money hater but for real : it's a joke , isn't it ?
playing and replaying and back again . i love this song . i heard it in my zumba class and it stuck in my head .
omg you must buy this album . linkin park has come back strong with this album ... it is a must have .
man , this album cold.stop hating on tip . i bet non of yah can out rap him.da king is back , enough said ! ! ! 1
tyga's hit song rack city is a classic strip club and dance track ! ! this will make the bass in your car or house slam too !
one of the best albums michael jackson has ever released . a gem ! solid music throughout .
hard-hitting sophomore starts strong , but throughout a brief ten tracks does show signs of uninspired repetition which weighs its total down quite a bit .
the video's okay only ciara acts like eartha kitt on acid other than that this sounds like one of jt's leftovers .
i wanted to hear some new music . i went over the songs and artist and decided to listen to the music one day .
enough bouncy retro-wave style to supply a nice nighttime ride , though short of zinner's important guitar tones not too much lasts .
i think this may be my favorite tori amos cd . i love it & listen to it all the time & have had it for over a decade ...
i love it . all of it and have just about everything that he has released . great piano and vocals on the songs
good , but not great . a few nice songs , my brave heart and put ' er there .
i'm not a mariah carey fan - - but her cover of this song is one of my favorite christmas songs .
it's another great song , i'm glad i got it i like some of his other music as well .
too bad this is only d . o . c great album ... a glimpse of what might have been .
not a big fan of the synthesizer / autotune mix in some places or the fact that most of the ideas aren't necessarily complete but still a fun song !
this cd is underated . it has some great tunes on it . check out " los angelenos " which really rocks .
i'm not a huge fan of this genre but i occasionally find a song i love in it , this is one of them !
constantly on the cusp of brilliance , this beautifully bubbling electro-pop rests quite comfortably in an impressive discography .
when i would have a party i would always have this song then me and my friends would jam out all night long
get these phyllis albums while you can as they were issued in 1999 . only 50,000 copies were pressed in japan
... four stars for " spread my wings " and " all i do is think of you " . great songs .
as all previous comments jimmy buffet is one hell of a god given talentnot one dud song on any of his albums
i purchased 3 or 4 roberta flack and it was so long ago that i no longer have it but donated it to a charitable cause to raise funds .
simply put , the royal scam is my favorite post aja steely dan album . very tight arrangments , punchy , good memorable songs .
if you don't own this - what ? i had to buy it on vinyl and add it to my collection - the entire album is gold . best .
i enjoyed there albums and this one is a good one to get if you are a fan of there music .
her best record and you will listen to it over and over again . purchase many and give as gifts . to all your friends
i always loved this album . in fact , i once had the album . this album shows the artist in some of his best music .
this was a high quality film like the other one . however no one with ever make a better one then the 1st .
its a good album ... good songs , good melodies , good guitar riffs ... not a great album , but one i am glad i own
if you still dont have this , shame on you.you ' re not a hip-hop fan if you dont like or have this.westside ! ! !
very catchy . her sound hasn't changed much , which is fine by me . i like this , though i wouldn't class it with her first album .
the best rapper that ever lived . best rap album ever . you are so missed big poppa !

this is one of steely dan's best albums and if you like the music of them you'll just have to have this one .
amazing stuff . i'm glad groups like this still exist . and you get the video on the cd as well .
amazon mp3 is the best app for a android ! without it i don't know how i would get any music !
one of the best songs , this is definitly on my favorite list . when you buy it you will play it over and over
exelent album one step more in the evolution of this great group , coheed & cambria one of the best new band in prog rock
this record is hot ! every track is blazin ' ... dont skip this its ja's second best ( vvv is his best )
to much of a repetative beat , not enough lyrics , and lyrics are too repetative . more singing might have helped , grin .
if you like this cd , you'll love the new fozzy cd . both haven't left my cd player since i bought them .
cohen is able to craft such wonderful songs that are just unreveled by anything else . this man is a true visionary and poet .
this cd will probably be hard to find soon so get it now as it is one of the better no limt records .
i don't understand why it says this song is explicit but i still like this song . i like the melody and their voices .
love this songs it is amazing i love rihanna music because she is amazing artists and i love her album .

love this song i would recommend it to anyone , it downloaded great , i listen to it a lot and really enjoy it .
helps me for falling asleep . an alternative to just white noise . was very reasonably priced . a change of pace from my old white noise tracks .
from the objective reviewer ... sadly , the best song on the cd is the one non-duet song , " duets for one . " this just doesn't work .
bad in the best of ways ! this limited edition contains never before heard demos and comentaries by quincy jones .
what can i say - i like rush . this is a great addition to my collection that i didn't have .
this is one of the best busta rhyme album all the cuts are great good beat classic busta rhymes ! .
the best double rap album of all time . for 1996 tupac was truly ahead of his time
one of the all-time best complete albums ever ! tell me you can't start singing or dancing when our lips are sealed comes on ... my favorite ever !
this is a good album but there is only 8 track not includingintro or outro.that is the only downfall of the albumit's a great album .
i never heard of this in the day it was new , it is good stuff .
the track " 2 real " by ugk & mr . 3-2 is reason enough to at least check out this record ... love that track classic
great albumshe doesnt talk about hoes , rims , jewelry and stupid thingship-hop needs lady sovereign
i grew up with rush since 1987 . this was a good album to have again . i never though they would put this one on a gold cd .
this is sigel's best cd . the source gave his cd 4.5 mics ! that should tell you something . nas said it best compared to bean's jay's wack !
this is a purchase if you are a kendrick lamar fan . he has a great lyrical and storytelling ability whic is something that is lacking in current artists .
my daughter has figured out the " cups " part of this song , so while we listen , she plays along with the song .

wow this cd is the best . and its better because biggie rhyme flow is remarkable ! ! ! enough said . get the cd to see for yourself .
if you compare them to a lot of the british groups currently championed by the nme , the zutons are actually quite good . soemwhat innovative melodic rock .

nothing special about the song . can't stand the singer at all.yuck . this ain't the one but her husband got away free at last !
cupid's chokehold was a great song when it was called " breakfast in america " by supertramp . that was a great band . whatever happened to them ?
album is great , especially " love boat captain " and " green disease " . it's catchy and rhythmic . get now .
tracks : the city / tramp and the young girl / one way sunday / the ghetto / song for you / friends / solitude .
b4 he died he put this out . this symbolized his talent and passsiion towards tha game . rip
i enjoyed his 1989 album and his other solo one as well . it has good songs and davie crosby on it .

yadayadayada - luv him to death - man with talent ! in australia we suffer from withdrawals ! lol ! jb music hard to come buy ! come bak jb

fat joe's pop appeal is running low look for him to be in the 2000 where are they now list next fall .
i am not a huge kesha fan and pitbull's songs are hit or miss with me so this one is ok but not the best out there
this album is o . k beats lyrics are ok 1 star for guest apperingsthe other 3 stars are for the whole album.nice album
meth and red are a perfect duo . rza should have done more tracks , but all in all , this is a great , funny album .
although i bought this cd for just one song , " little talks , " i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the other songs
the singer sounds a bit like joe cocker wit a little chris robinson thrown in . love the reverby guitar on this recording !

out of all ... the dynasty ... did not sit well for me ! ! ! ... but he came back with a blast from blue print 1 .
this was the cd that made me listen to the music and realy understand this man called dmx there is no one realer 4 sure
thank you amazon for having this available . i purchased this to replace an old lp . i have always love this release .
got this for my girlfriend who is a lady gaga fan and to be honest she's starting to rub off on me
another hip-hop album with the same tired ghetto-wannabe lyrics , boring backbeats and childlike stabs at humor . when will this misery end ?
awesome early album from the jackson 5 . a must have for any michael jackson fan . this helped me complete my mj collection .
love this song and i could listen to it over and over . it downloaded great and sounds really good all the time .

delivery clyrics cproduction cstyle c + heart c + ( becuz of buck ) overall c
i must have liked some songs on this one . they are great musicians .
classic album ... every song is awsomebefore you judge xzibit off of restless or man vs . machine , at least give this a listen
from the objective reviewer ... " shine on through " is the one decent song , but elton and pop disco don't work well together .
phyllis hyman had a voice that would just make you melt . she had it all . she left us much too soon and she is surely missed .
his cds r in every car and truck i own this man has helped me threw some of the roughest times of my life if he only knew

if not the continual quantum shift forward from the brilliant arrival point of tb , this is as solid as mainstream classic r & b got on record .

great edition , sounds fantastic , i am not sure if they have more in stock , but absolutely i am happy with the main source ..
yeah it's missing some of the other great songs from marvin . that means go buy the album that contains the other hits .
i love every cd they come out with , i think that every cd they come out with is better then the year before . worth the money
all great songs , catchy and has tons of relistening potential ! this is one of the better albums to come out this year .

niiice album . nice to just sit and relax to . some good stuff in the cd .
bonnie at her best as always ! she is awesome and i love this music as it crosses barriers in the way she belts it out .

i would like a little more variety . and does vocalist have to speak on every song ? i guess he does .
everything said in the title . game went hard on this an nobody really knows about it . go get this onebest tracksjesus piecename me kingpraysee no evilhallelujahali bomaye

timbaland's beat is boring kanye did'nmt impress me neyo sucks like always keri's alright though swear all this neosoul is sounding more like techno .
this is one of the top k-pop songs out today . great flow and sound and obviously very popular with a fun dance .
classic cube ... whatever happened to the days of rappers really speaking the truth and what was on their minds ? keep it real !
to me it talks of loneliness and isolation . it helps me realize it is not so bad . also at the same time it makes me believe more .
this cd sounds pretty good . i purchased it for 2 songs only , which i love .
white flag ... wow ! ! ! that song is awesome ! i enjoyed all of the songs . beautiful voice and a keeper on my cd shelf .
this cd sucks , i wouldn't suggest this album to jay-z himself , this is a bunch of crap , don't buy it .
i love this new cd ! ronald did good ! congrats to kandy and ronald on their new baby ! 5 star cd ! * * *
as with most modern hip-hop it is okay the first few times you listen to it , but then it gets old and loses its intrigue .
this is an awful album which should be best left behind in the eighties.dated boring dance pop music which you should avoid at all costs.no stars .
straight up , this album sucks , the lyrics is wack and so is the beats . mystical next time do beter .
buddy guy knows how to sing the blues . this is an excellent album to add to a collection . very good listening !
this is a pure classic-pure and simple - a pure classic - every joint is bangin - this is what we call real hip hop
chistion gray all the time when i here this song thats how i learn about this song and it is hot " 50 shades of gray "
vanilla ice can rap better than 50 cent somebody needs to geta dollar buck and knock this retarted bitch out
seems like they were just trying to make an extra buck by releasing versions that weren't included on the other cd .
" inner city life " is one of the best songs that i've ever heard . this is an incredible cd .
great , i repeat great cd , well worth the money . it's one of her best !

i really enjoy this disc not only for " the girl from ipanema " but the other tracks as well . very strong effort .

great songyou'll love itthis lady sings her little heart outshe's awsomebuy ityou will likefive star
i had been searching for some of tweet's music and now i have found it . i would definitely advise the purchase of this soulful cd .

this is one of the finest goth albums ever made ! every song is a classic.buy , buy , buy ...
very cool cd from what i believe to be a new band ... hard core rock and roll for the most part . you will not be disappointed
what a great album ! never heard of this band until one song on the radio - - the whole album is awesome .
adventurous , visionary bits of ear candy to catalyze wonderful new neural arrangements . spacey indeed .
we're not caught up in your love affair . thats a very interestingly interesting interest filled statement of interest to be interested in if you na mean .
i heard devil went down to georgia the other day and ran out and bought this album , it doesn't disappoint .
i love this album , it's so much fun to listen to . another one that remains in my car at all times .

i think she tries a bit too hard . it's good , but just o . k .
sevyn streeter so far she great and her songs is to i love this songs who would fell in love with this songs
from start to finish , an excellently executed album with dope production from dj paul and juicy j . one of the best albums of 2006 .
another beautiful cd by loreena mckennitt . she is so talented and her voice is magical . my favourite song is the parting glass .
i didn't think it was possible but nickel creek surpased themselves and man is it awesome they are geniouses
this is a great soul album that , other than the superior modern sound quality , sounds like it was found in a lost time capsule from the 70s .
a hasbeen rapper wack beats trying to hard to be mainstream his career is through .
she's too cool for me , and my friend calls her provocative . i have to listen to her songs to understand what it means to be cool .
buisness as usual is an absolutely brilliant album and a treat for the ears.get this with their sophomore cd cargo .
than another air album ? wow , what an impressive group and what an impressive album . not just entertaining , but interesting as well .
grown up and spaced out is all i can say about this joint ... it's ablazing . must cop , real soulful . peace
ll cool j is back and smashing the game this album is highly recomended for real hip hop lovers tight stuff ll still got it back hard .
though the lyrics make little sence , the song is good and has a nice beat that people can rock out to .
the album version is slower and loses its punch . this radio edit is just the right length . more is not always better .
this is a good song ! great to dance to and workout to . pitbull always has good songs though . really gets the blood pumping !
this album is amazing ... bone thugs are one of the best . highlightsevery song ... the intro is insane
this the real big pun greatest hits ! his verses will live on forever - word is born ! ! buy this ! pun kills everyone on his verses !
this album is starting to age . it needs to be remastered . i will buy it again . overall a great album from begining to end .
i like this song and had to get it the kids like it a good beat with a good voice and the song has good meaning get it
2 1/2 a few standout moments do not justify all the artistic praise in what is essentially consciously experimental , hardcore punk-politics .
i love it.red hot chili peppers is great for older peoplethat still think their hip , tho .
who needs superman when you have superwoman . a voice that packs a huge punch . a great album . barbra's voice is timeless .
great album . black rob is awesome . i very occasionaly like east-coast musik but this is great . this album is definitely worth getting .
i hate e - 40 , but i gave this 3 stars cuz that song " rapper's ball " is off the hook !
listened to this whole 2 - disc set on a road trip yesterday.here ' s a tip.listen to mars first.but it's all good.and dani california is sweet home alabama .
one of the best dance / electronic songs you can find anywhere . the song is filled with some crazy beats . it's their best song to date .
who doesn't like clapton ? derek and the dominos music has always been some of my favorite clapton and this album of great classics doesn't disappoint !
started as my boyfriends favorite song that he played on report and now it has grown on me and i love it too
the game's second album is the best rap album ever . if you don't have it then go get it .
all of bob dylans music just blows and it sounds worse nowyour voice is boring and your voice is ignoring .
i love katy perry and this is another great song by her and a must have for any katy perry fan !
this is a good one to have because it has hits you don't hear any more on the radio now a days .
this is a nice best of and a great introduction to sade for the newbie !
loved this song since the second i heard it and i mean the lyrics hit home and the melody haunts yer mind all day after listening to it !
but i think the crossing were one hit wonders . this cd is well worth the price but there aren't a lot of really memorable tracks .
" astrolounge " is smash mouth's best release , it's good-sounding , not explicit . however , i should suggest using more instruments to these guys .
as good as da las ' album . the best song i would say is track 4 . really good album .
this cd is mad hot . i like all the beats to every song . ja brings it hard .
1 1/2 a bloated lightweight , pseudo-heavy , post-punk over-citation disguises its compositional inadequacies inside undercooked experimentation and wins due to such low relative expectation .
it wasn't quite what i was expecting considering the songs that i've heard on pandora . still a good album , just a little surprising .
a strong opening , if somewhat familiar ; the vocals on this track are crisp and clear and the lyrics are good too .
it katy perry first hit highly recommend it a very different song but if you collecting katy perry music it must have ! ! !
hard to categorize , but all the same great singer / songwriter . always with a top notch band . unique sound with continues to produce joy .
everything on this album is very deep and summed up in the title . another amazing ablum by the master leonard cohen .
good songs , all of them . too bad this is his last albume =(
bought this for my wife and it's a pretty good song . most of their songs are pretty good so i'm sure the album is worth it
this is a good intro album . kick back with a glass of scotch and listen to this one . very mellow . the music is fantastic .
sadly , this is boh's worst album to date . this album is tired , bland , and uninspired . what a terribly boring shame .
i was a fan of michael bolton from almost the beginning . loved his voice and the songs . will be listening to this cd for a long time .
i was waiting for justin timberlake to come back out , the singing world was a blur without him . and he came back stronger , better and smoother .
i got this one because it was offered for free . it is not something i listen to on a normal day but it's okay
if you are a black sheep fan then you will love wolf in sheep clothing add this to your collection .
hot album go get it really don't have to say much because when you go pick up a copy you will find out
this album was one of her best and still sounds great after all of these years . i enjoyed the interview on the dvd side .
the music is as bad as the woman behind it ... tacky ! horrible lyrics , music , and just over all blah ! don't recommend
great album , one of jay-z's best . an album you can bang from start to finish .
wat upthis is greatread my other review for the other smashmouthits the same as thismy favorite smashmouth cd
if you love hendrix , you'll be all over this . great performance , excellent recording . i am hoping the series of superb hendrix releases continues .
great song to dance to ! i like pitbull and ke $ ha . irs different and it's gets your heart pumping ... get it !
one of my favorite songs of last year . top 5 . i hope they continue producing really good music for a really long time .
kept hearing it on the microsoft commercial . had to buy it . i love this song . recommend to anyone who loves a good story .
this is one of the last cds i'll be buying for my buffett collection . thanks to amazon's selection . what a great cd !
this was a surprise for a christmas song to listen to . it should be added to your christmas song list too !
and thats the only good thing about the cd . dj quik sucks , but he got good hair .
each song has a great sound to it ! this album is much better than the one that came out after . definitely a buy . 5/5
deck the hallstwisted sisternow who doesn't love this beautiful song ? is exceptionally great as the twisted sisters sing it .
this is the best and my favorite r . kelly's album . nuff said .
this album is hot and g-unit is still blazing . almost every track is great . favorite is probablt stomp . its hot ! !
why this was even on my list of items to review , i never downloaded it .
my most favorite 80 ' s group . " all this love " is my all time favorite song . a must have for all debarge fans .
this album is a nice treat , maybe you could find some on a greatest hits album but not all these nice nuggets .
i didn't really care for this song and feel like i wasted my money , the preview sounded good but the rest of the song is trash
i just watched the music video and made me like the song even more .
i think this was a free song i down loaded to get the full version . once i down loaded it i didn't really care the full version .
i was extremly satisfied with this album . when u talk u only say something u already know - when u listen u learn what someone else knows ! !
this is one of the great hip-hop albums of all time . " deltron 3030 " is another one . buy this or live a deprived existence .
it is worth the money.it is relaxing to listen to while you read and i also play it while i go to sleep .
the hole world could relax if they would get this album ... think about it ?
this song brings back memories of my college years . i miss this type of music where the message was clear .
this album is so wack i rarely play it . dirt's first album was far better . this is actually a waste of money .
this a classic biggie is the man he has great lyrics pick this album up .
a great collection by singer / songwriter mickey newbury . my 2 favorites or " san francisco mabel joy " and " american trilogy " . worth a listen .
this is an exampleof paul mccartney , solo artist , wings , at his best .. intonationthroughout is ok ... andit holds together well
pitbull , you have done it again . how can you keep coming up with these awesome songs ? will your talent ever run out ?
been there done that sound . i can think of a thousand bands that deserve the deluxe remastering treatment over this drivel .
i can't wait to look back on this song and it's popularity in ten years . i'm picturing something along the lines of a vh1 special .
and , god forbid , do not miss out on this remastering . it makes this excellent cd that much more outstanding .
keep on walking did well on the r & b charts aswell.either way finally is definatly her biggest hit .
always been a fan of this hot mess ! this song makes me wanna speed down the road in my wreck of a car
one of my favorite christmas songs as nd this version dose not disappoint . i like the total instrumental of this song .
this is arguably fnm's best release . i think they're all gravy , but this one stands out for most .
great song . would definitely recommend this song to anyone who enjoys music , especially boy bands . onedirection seems to be the " it " band right now .
this album rewrote the rules of the motown hit factory . it was full of insperation and social commentary , with wonder producing , writing and playing himself .
ok i gave it 3 stars but next time i wont know fa show , i doubt if i'll cop tha next ! !
baby is a wack rapper , and whoever writes his music should be fired , enough said . not recommended .
i loved the documentary and doctors advocate , but this album is just averagetop tracksmoneymy lifedope boysangelletter to the kinglax files
do not purchase this download . track 15 has a serious glitch in it at about 2:30 seconds . it may well be in the master , too .
delivery a + lyrics aproduction c + style a + heart a + overall a -
i love joss's last album , but this is even better . fresh , soulful and full of personality .
some of the brit-pop & alternative act's most reliable work , with a track-by-track compositional consistency that puts apathetic future work to shame .
my g.daughter wanted this song , she loves it . selena has a very sweet , beautiful voice . she's going to go very far in her profession .
this album is better than his debut . it's leaner and meaner.rest in peace ol ' dirty .
this is a definate departure from the first album , its not bad , but not really " d12 " .
all 14 tracks are good . strange but good . their not your normal rock band .
when we were driving through the sinai , which was like being on the moon , this is one of the records we listened to .
this song is really well simple , it's a mixture of depression and romance . defiantly worth listening too , adele does very well ( like usual . )
i wasn't too impressed with this full album . i don't recommend buying it - - snagging it from another friend , sure ... buying it ? nah ...
that's what this song makes you . love this song . after the grammys , i had to get this song . just happy ! !
it is not a favoriteson gof mine but a good song . i would recommand to a friend or family member .
tanya was one of the good lady singers back then and i liked her tnt album also this one good to
i love this old music compared to new music . that is what makes it classic rock . thanks for making it available and keeping the price low .
crescent is a more relaxed album than what jazz legend john coltrane was later to offer . it was recorded in 1964 , precedinga love supreme . mighty fine !
i got this one for my father for fathers day thats comming up in june . he always like his music and his live stuff too .
this album is good , it was put together well . i'm happy with it , and would recommend it to eagle fans .
for any george fan , this is an excellent compliment for any incomplete collection of his solo work . rest in peace oh " quite beatle "
no jacket required , has favorites of mine like sussudio , one more night , don't lose my number and take me home . good cd .
i like the reggae sound a lot in this song . i heard it on the radio and really liked it a lot .
that is exactally what every album by this no talent hack sounds like but isure iron mike could write better lyrics .
this album has tons of meaning and his lyrics are wonderful . if you are a rap fan , this will not disappoint you ! !
love katy perry and all her music , the amazon cloud is great way to get music and hold it , use it all the time
no matter what critics ( including amazon's very own ) say , badmotorfinger is soundgarden's rocks . an all-time classic , their strongest effort across the board ... - craig
the lyrics ob this song are so powerful ans meaningful that it can be confusing whether it is paramore or not . but it is .
how did this become a hit ? surprised at how much i like it . highly recommended and in my top 5 this year so far .
i've always liked this song . it doesn't seem to ever go out of style as time goes by . fun to listen to .
this was a good listen for me . i wasn't very familiar with sarah mclachlan's music before this and now i've bought four of her other albums .
amazing cd , replacing the old vinyl . i loved seeing it on amazon . the service was great . i need to replace some others .
reminds me of the go gos . but a little less dramatic and more lively . enjoyable and entertaining . feels go to listen .
i can't believe this would get anything less than 5 stars . this cd is a classic ! jeezy keeps it 100 all day
juel's bored look on the album cover perfectly reflects the music it contains . great for insomniacs .
and to offset some of those uninformed 1 star reviews ... don't listen to them . this is a terrifically atmospheric album . buy it .
downloaded this to my amazon mp3 player . i have all of adele's albums and this is up there as on emy favorite songs .
great cd to add to any collection ... great range of songs , a great cd for any music lover ... go grab it
all i have to say is if u dont have it then u should go and get it .
this is so romantic and touching , i can picture him talking to someone very special in this song , it's a very upbeat song , will make you smile
this is a must have for serious d'angelo fans . this one will be in rotation for a long time . this is the d'angelo i want back .
how can you go wrong with carole king - stayed in bed all morning is something to strive for ! love it1
if you call yourself a fan of dj quik , you should feel required to listen to this album . it's wonderful .
if you enjoy high quality music , diamonds is a great place to start , period . this album was my intoduction to ben harper
this is the worst piece of crap ive ever heard . avoid at all costs .
a classic rock masterpiece ! ! ! a + five stars ! ! ! a landmark recording ! ! ! two thumbs up ! ! !
this is for lost teenagers who want to experiment drugs , and promiscuous sex .
one great disc amy grant did a standout cd ask me what a touching song that tells a story of child abuse
a great follow to the great milenko , their best album , and was well worth the 5 dollars i paid for it on sale . would highly recommend .
this is by far the most pathetic reunion album in the last 10 years . pure garbage from the fathers of gay goth , emo gayrock .
i like this song a lot , but i feel like it sounds like 50 million other songs . he he ha ha .
i like this song , it is worth buying and spending the money on . instrumentals and the vocals are great . good lyrics .
has some great songs on it . if you are a slow jam person , you would like it !
nothing special or great . it was downloaded to test my amazon download app . i listened to it but it was well .. ok
clue is kool with me no problem ... also grow up , me and my hommies buying his mix tapes , back in the 90 ' s
umm .. this album is trash . 50 cent is good , but the rest of the group sucks . go cop that .
lauryn hit solid gold with this album . the choice cuts are doo wop , everything is everything and lost ones . this deserves every grammy given to it .
this awesome cd contains all of blur's hits . a must have for all blur fans.brit pop at its best .
i don't live this way but it's still fun to sing along like i do . people with more money can do that every friday night .
the new ja album , like all ja albums is garbage . even though the beats are better , he still sounds like ja . avoid this .
this is another favorite group of mine and also how chaka kahn got her start . those were the days of good music .
this is carefree music , for sure . i have nothing else like it in my collection . much of it is very lighthearted . enjoy !
ih's third substitutes emo-dance production finesse for the nitty-gritty emotional melodics that sustained her past greater writings , if still creating a completely listenable driving disc .
? ? ? find another cd cause by now no limit has lost it .
this cd is okay , but come on this is supposed to be nofx . nofx has alot of better albums than this .
premier pop music at its peak . critics are sometimes without a clue . they were with this band . 19 ( ! ) great songs on one cd .
classic electronic pop album . not a bad song on the record . kevin barnes is the new thin white duke .. as in today's artists ..

i love this song ever since i first heard on the radio and since him performed it on the grammys .
this disc is manily highlighted by grant green who sets the pace really highly.donald byrd's is good but green really stands out here.overall very essential music .
sorry jigga ! this wasnt.my best jay z cds but i do love bonnie and clyde and excuse me miss ! the other songs are ok !

only worth buying for two songs . the trippy " porpoise song " and " daddy's song " , where davy goes sammy davis jr . on the audience .
it's still amazing though , perhaps his most pychdelic album . a gem of soorts
very awesome song . love the harmony and the up beat tone to the song . a must have for the holidays .

a required listening for students of hardcore gangsta rap . it's magic on a cd . very necessary . i got my copy .
energetic if predictable blues-rock , beck's influence is deserved but an esteemed debut is little more than dirty-white blues 101 .
this is a really nice soulful sound from gnarls barkley i heard on the radio and decided to download the mp3 . toe tapping tune .
on fire and runnin with the devil are greatest songs ! they will be played in my home many many times !

i love this music . one republic is definitely a good band and i highly recommend this song . listen and enjoy .
several great pop tracks , exquisitely arranged , make for pleasurable , relaxing listening . however , a few tracks sound like filler to me .
3 1/2 d'ange strives for a smooth but gritty , instrumentally-stressed , eclectic neo-soul masterwork and comes just short of lofty ambitions .
well i bought the wrong cd . i wanted the dance amd i got this instead . not very good . there is mabey 3 good songs on the cd
been rolling with mary from day 1 . she never disappoints , and i enjoyed her acting too . keep growing and continue to have a blessed life .

this song sticks in your head long after you listen to it . pitbull and havana brown have a club anthem here
let her go is a groovy kind of track . old school beat yet timeless to listen to . memories of an old flame come to mind .
we knew she could bare us emotionally with her own compositions , then she manages to unleash that same power revisiting covers . it was foreshadowing .
this was free and i didn't even download it . i'm not a big fan of the harpsichord and this is not my style .
very pretty addition to my long list of christmas music . recommend highly . i love when amazon has specials on single songs , especially when they are free !

i like lorde very much . for a 17 - year-old , she displays a remarkable degree of maturity . one of new zealand's greatest exports .
more on the light side of synth music . if you like erasure neuropa you'll like this . take on me is one of the happiest melodic songs ever .

this is all carly . the sound that only she posesses . she is a classic . i loved this album . what more can i say .
this song is way too repetitive . shows lazy songwriting on her or her team's part . lacks the magic of past singles like lights or anything can happen .
i think this is a great song . never heard of this group before . i ' ll surely check out more songs from them .
check out a real hip hop artist like afroman . his disc jambs . join the streetteam on his website . truly be a part of his recoreds
aerosmith's " get your wings " was a success , among many people questioned aerlier . it's okay .
halcyon is the best , other than that , the other tracks aren't that good .
not much to really say about his one . it's just ok in my book .. the price was right on this one !
making this record , stevie wonder would often stay in the studio 48 hours straight , not eating of sleeping , while everyone around him struggled to keep up

this cd is pretty good and an excellent follow up to his first cd .
this song is great , fun melody , nice clean lyrics , and a fun style to it that pulls you in even if your not usually into blues .

one of the best in r & b . timberland is a master at beats !
the whole cd is exactly what it says in the title super tight ... 4 real this ugk at its best .
2 1/2 slightly juiced downtempo usually falls prey to simplistic songwriting and bland beats even if maintaining the credible background consistency of production soul-finesse .

let me get this straight the wost rappers alive ( g-unit ) on the same album as 2pac , plain and simple hip-hop is dead .
it has several b-side tracks yet no ' i'm on fire ' or ' my hometown'ridiculus .
ok i found her voice above the rest . as well as her style . so might i say this is a true artist and a very good buy .
norah jones is good , and feels like home is good music , but overall , she is overrated .
i like how the beasite boys experiment with their sound and they definitley do that on this one , it's a must own .
i like this cd - not my favorite maybe , but it's enjoyable . i like her voice , reminds me of florence ( and the machines ) .
great song , i love the beat and the words . it is funny had a just a beautiful song can be about a prostitute with a drug problem .
no big surprise , i had bigger hopes ... also it's bad that skits aren't on separate tracks so they would be easier to skip ... rating 3.5 / 5

the lead singer has the most beautiful vocals no dream pop / shoegaze lover could ever imagine . hoarse whispers from angelic creatures singing jazzy solos in unison .
dope beats , wicked lyrics an all around phat cd , it's the best cd juvi has put out , it's diffinatley the rap cd for tha 90 ' s
... this guy did " i'm in you ! " excellent rock album from a great artist / guitarist . glad to see pete still making music .
bluesy , jazzy , sad . back to black is specifically haunting considering how winehouse passed . it makes you wonder what her potential would have been .

john hiatt has that unique voice witch reaches out to your soul to tell a story . something that you want to hear .
this is one of the punk / new wave masterpieces for sure . great , clever songwriting , infectious beats , searing vocals . a landmark album .

nothing about this song makes any sense , however it is the music that grabs you , you cant help but move to it
the best hip hop cd yet buy it . you can't live without it . every song is good
ja rule sucks that is all i gotta say ... he should be 50 ' s maid
this is a great collection of her hits . great jazz and soul works well with her smooth voice .
in my opinion , anita baker is the best singer of our time . i keep a copy of rapture at work , in my car and at home .
the only thing that distinguishes this band from most of the other new wanna-be new waver bands is a distinct lack of musical talent .
i love this song . i could listen to this 24 hours a day . beautiful haunting melody . one of the best from mmj .
had no expectations about this album.this album was well put together , the songs mix brilliant lyrics and score.haven ' t got tired of listening to this one .
but very good . can't say nothing bad about this cd . get this if you are a rap fan .
there are 3 classics on here , & they are its so hard , 100 % & ms . martin , peace ! ! !
it took a few spins , but ultimatly , i think this is my least favorite volta album . but even my least favorite doesn't mean it's bad .
but then , i am not a preschooler . or a raffi fan apparently . nice little song , for little kids to enjoy .
the lyrics are just awesome . great sing-along song , i love to belt it out in the car ( or anywhere that others cannot necessarily hear me ) .
from start to finish , this album is dark and interesting . its a great album and possibly better than dirt.worth the buy !
for lil flip it is game over . because cd sucks . one good songs out of two discs . that is bad . 2 out of 5
what ever happened to this group ? they had some good songs . everyone loved candy rain .
i love her voice on these songs , carly has such a unique voice , and i think it's beautiful ,
i gave this song 5 stars because it simply is a fun song . i thought it was a creative song .
this song cusses too much so it is not a good song i will not be listening to this song anymore
excellent rockin ' music . i can't being to describe you have to listen and be carried away by profound rock and roll angst .
if you like showoff check out chris from showoffs new band farewell my enemy at [ ... ] they are really f'n awesome.tom
there has been a lot said about this album that i feel that there is nothing really left to say but get this album if you havent heard it .
major disappointment . while it's great to hear biggie's voice , this album is most definately not worthy of him ; lyrics are overall weak & beats are lacking .
interesting cover of the song , a nice break from the standard christmas fare that runs in my ipod in the winter .
this is definitly stevie at his best ! ! but there are some filler like the instrumentals but the rest are wonderfull . i recommend it .
great song with a great meaning ! ! ! songs can always mean something different to different people so listen to it and see what you take from it .
please don't get me wrong i love the debut but embrya really shows maxwells talent.if you love urban hang suite or now you must have this one .
nice cd , not as good as the first couple , but after a five year break it seems like they haven't lost any of their talent .
for those who are jd collectors or for those who are just discovering his music , this is one of those " must have " albums .
a great club song ! you can dance along in your car or at the club ! absolutely love it ! ! must buy !
this 1 of the greatest ll albums there is even though it has a lot of samples , you can listen with just about anybody good cd ! ! !
listening to some of the oldies makes my day . this album is a classic and i am glad that i was able to find it again .
who would not want this divas music if you purchase this one you got the best music ever sung of a female singer
i remember hearing playa with jay and amil on this a long time ago , but just got to hear the whole album recently . its hot
its always great to throw on some 2pac no matter what kind of mood your in . its great to have it on vinyl .
this album is one of the best of it's time.when this album came out bad boy was doing good for themselves.biggie is nothing more than a memory .
one republic is one of my most favorite bands and once again put out an awesome song . it just makes me feel good !
arguably the best album bruce has ever released . there , i said it . now call me crazy but i bet springsteen would agree with me .
the best cd of 2005 . the dvd is awesome as well . keep it dipset ! ! !
the whole was a good listen but there is something missing that would have made it 5 stars . it was enjoyable nonetheless .
very " emo " , filled with sappy moments . original sounds that are downplayed by the lyricism . still something good to listen to .
watching my 6 year old dance around the house whenever this song plays , is a hoot and makes me " happy " .
this is a nice song , although sounds different than what i'm used to . was free , so it was worth it !
they play loud , so turn it up loud . these guys can rock it . these guys can roll it . deep purple ... support your favorite artists .
new levelthe god emcee has risenall hailfeel what he feelsgod will always prove the devil to be a liar ... that nigga jigga .
this is the worst and hopefully the last whack nas album ; lucky for him he redeemed himself on stllmatic .
i enjoyed her first two albums . can't wait for her new one coming out this year . this is for any fan of hers .
snagged this when it was on sale . i only had a few of the tracks on this cd . if you like the eagles , definitely worth it .
will downing is a great singer . i saw him in concert at the jazz festival in md . i love hearing his soultry voice and great music
i found it a little flat compared to her solo stuff but i'm glad i bought it . her voice is great no matter the setting .
miles and gil really work it out . all the stuff of this period in miles's career are timeless . classy stuff .
a great cd . one of simon's best and one of the best album's to come out of the 80 ' s . you absolutely must buy this cd .
hey man you gotta check this vibe out man you gotta be open minded about music to appreciate it though worth a listen .
for pure pop songs that are adult radio hits ; it's hard to beat train.they are not lyrical masters but the singers voice is great .
do i need to say anymore this is one of the best rap album and also one of the last great rap albums .
although i am not into this type of rap anymore ( i'm 30 ) . i loved this album when i was an 18 year old college kid .
scary greatson vinyl sounds addingin syncand violent malice tvthat eats us rawit lived a broken heartdon amman
robert johnson blows the mind.his music is so incredible.his tones are rich & timeless.he is a catelog unto himself.you feel the depth & heart in his playing.very essential .
this is really good with the sundazed mono version . this is jeff beck , ron wood , and pre-schmuck rod stewart , when he was really good .
allison krauss has an amazing voice . her band is good too . easy listening and easy to hum or sing along .
the music is still great to me and currant with times never gets boring listening to seal was worth the money
mjb continues to bring the goods on this album . good songs with passion & emotion that me you feel her message .
anyway this cd deserves to be remastered and re-released for it's 20th anniversary . i think def jam can afford that .
great cd my favorite from ugk . rip pimp c this cd looks better then the original i used to own .
i have a review for the regular massacre cdoutta control ( regular ) was the best song on the massacre . now they have a crappy remix
for the most part , a sweet , good-natured pop album that recalls a more innocent age .
... if you dont know nothin about the slow-burn , they can teach ya somethin ! ! ! ...
1 1/2 aside from few fleeting moments of engaging experimentation , the group's sketchy framework exposes a decayed underbelly of creative drought .
i really enjoy the cd . glad i added it to my collection . it brings back memories from my teen-age days . rock on .
american idol made me think singing was lame . this album changed my mind .
if you a fan of this group you will find this highly enjoyable and great listening music . highly recommended to buy
who wouldn't want to dance like a flower ? this music makes your mind wander to a more beautiful place . everyone should own the nutcracker suite .
i love this collection of his music , truly classic . it's a little bit of summer you can enjoy all year round .
tony yayo used to be so hard before he went to jail i think they took his manhood he's really gay now u used to have it yayo
nothing really stands out about this . it's not horrible but it's not great either . i just found this one bland .
it just what i need i love elton john . he simple put is awesome ! ! ! and this is all of his songs ! ! !
this album is great . great tunes , singing and overall you want to sing and dance along to these as bryan pulls you into the mix .
use to hear this all the time back in the 80s . had it for free one day and added it back into our system for nostalgia
kendrick lamar is my favorite rapper so i like just about anything he does . he's very lyrical and this is another brilliant example of how his mind works
i'm a huge eminem fan and just can't resist this song . let's face it aren't we all a little crazy ? ? ?
on mrs . hathaway new cd tracks 3,7- 10 & 12 are excellent.good cd.rest of songs don , t quite fit with song tracks that were excellent .
jone's voice is so mellow as is her music . this is great to listen to for all occasions .
another fine concert from jimi that was recorded perfectly . some older and newer tunes . wish i was there . i bet you do too .
everyone young and old will like this song . like that i can buy it on amazon and get it put in my cloud immediately .
is going to go places . they have a great sound , and their music a catchy and upbeat . i predict them going far !
not bad finally an r & b cd which does'nt deal with the usaul .
one of my all time favorite christmas songs ! i love listening to this every year . it reminds me of what christmas is all about !
tight 2pac aka makaveli the don album ! i currently own all of his stuff down to the books , so i know whats hot ... pick it up now
brian mcknight's " back at one " is a great album with beautiful music and a man with a voice like butta ... you be the judge ...
i really only like 1 song " i want love " but the album itself is ok & i do like elton's piano playing
lovely music - especially dreamland and the title song . this has been in my collection and worn out , replaced and worn out again ...
nice collection of taylor's music . she has her own sound and i enjoy it . you should enjoy it as well .
love this cd to bad it was the last wings recored , all were gems the lp did not far good on release but it was still great .
i love this cd and he's my all time favorite rapper and always will be thank you for the cd .
this is typical melissa etheridge and if you like her , then this will not dissapoint you either , her gravily voice and strong vocals are as usual great .
love this song , can not hear it enough . play it over and over again , my hubby is sick of it i'm sure ! ! !
wasn't that big of a fan of flo rida in the past but i like this song and the new stuff he's coming out with , cathcy
as good a balance of familiar and fresh found , from one of the only relevant tex-mex sounds around .
this is better than blueprint pt . 2 he shows he is better than jay-z .
in true b - 52s fashion , this song has some strange lyrics . this is such a catchy tune . it just puts you in a good mood .
justin can sing and i love the suit & tie song . it makes me want to get up and dance everytime i hear it play .
billy paul was more than one song.he can sing with emotion & feeling.this set highlights his great talent . a very powerful voice who is very underrated .
the best since " tha block is hot " that's all i got 2 say .
i got in to his music in 2011 when he came out with some one i use to know . it was a good song and a good album .
jay-z and the r . o . c killed them so badly with this album
song is good , even though i am very confused on what small talk is being used . . . .  .
this is the album that was made from the pricrtice sessions in the big pink house basement tapes . great for hard core the band fans .
1976 was the year of the funk and p-funk was at the top of the list ! keep funkin george .
i can't explain why , but i really like this song and have added it to my collection of music i listen to while walking .
i like this song . i only got this one song , so don't know what the whole album sounds like , but this one is enjoyable .
i've been replacing my old worn out 33 rpm records with cd's . this was one i had and loved and replaced .
this album is good . i think many will sleep on this cd . it's very nice . i really like the track slow f * * * .
i like this song ! it's got some good bass to it and is a good pump up the volume song .
if it werent for the 3 add on songs it would be 1 star , nice to sleep to though
a couple good songs , but as a whole a pretty weak cd in my mind . i really like liztomania but its largely alone to me
just not one of my favorites for an entire cd of songs , but she still has an incredibly unique soulful sound !
not a mainstream hit but had some joints on here.top tracks : back seatpink cookieshow i'm cominfunkadelic relicbuckem down
adele is a goddess . her voice is so amazing and to combine that beauty and talent with the james bond franchise was genius . bravo .
different from most of mk's other album but love the guitar playing ! ! ! a must for any collection , especially if you have never heard chet atkins .
tha most out selling album ! ! ! of all time , back then ! ! ! no one could compare ! ! !
empty sky was is first , but this is what set his career off and running . some good tunes on this one .
bought this just to get the song , dont worry . love this album and it brings but really good memories of college days .
heard this on television and loved it . good song for walking and exercising . fast and fun . enjoy listing to this group
one of my favorite albums growing up . i don't need no doctor is rock n roll at its finest.love it
i love the cd love all the 80 ' s is the best and i would recommend to anyone exspecially to my family and friends .
a cross between cheryl crow and the dixie chicks . is it true that there is really nothing new under the sun ?
rock singer jewel is definitely showing better writing skills and vocal performances on her second record spirit . " hands " rocks !
this is perhaps some of his best work . i have enjoyed the evolving styles that jr . has continued to develop throughout his musical career .
the album is all florence , as expected . very spatial sounding with her voice going all over the place . highly recommended .
jill scott is a mixture of sade w / flavor , erika badu w / enunciation , and mary j . w / a vocabulary .
the guy has no rap skills whatsoever.the music is a bad joke.he has style but it has nothing to do with music at all .
great , gotta love the song shook ones part 2 also survival of the fittest ... those are very exellect tracksbeats and lyrics deserve a 5/5
the used is amazing and if you liked showoff check out chris from showoffs new band farewell my enemy at [ ... ] they are really f'n awesome.tom

i really like this song , i've like miley's music . this was a very good song . looking forward to her other music .
stevens ' mbj album makes the perfect sister album to his tea for the tillerman . together they complete some of his best work .
despite what some reviewers have said , this is a decent album with some good songs.what ' s freaky is how close this guy sounds to biggie .
i gave this cd four out of five stars because even though i love three days grace , i haven't listened to the cd yet .
ice cube at his finest this album and amerikkka's most wanted are certified classic .. 5 mics get it now ! !

mc eight had a good run ... back in tha dayz ... i'll never forget his hardcore classics.must try must buy .
whos fallen off worse ? ja rule or nas ? ehh .. they both are awful now . avoid this stinker .
unlike later efforts , rubin actually did streamline all the chili pepper's flavorful funk-rock divisions into a most cohesive effort to date , even with light latter-half repetition .
kept hearing it on the radio and i liked the hook.downloaded it and i enjoy this song for sure .
lovely to listen to . i love it , has beautiful music and easy to relax to . great to listen to anytime and helps me relax .
another good one by blondie ! can't go wrong with the vocals ! debbie is vibrant and strong as always . she hasn't changed .
i love christmas songs and i like big daddy weave . so of course i like this song . it is a very nice christmas song
nothing remarkable but several nice tracks . if you like vega you will like this cd .
... unpretentious , unassuming , straight ahead , dreamy and groovin ' , sade's best reminds us of what we need more of ...
any fan of the eagles should add this to their collection . the style is classic , and the memories just keep flooding back .
i like the cd but its not as good as their older ones , but i think its something you got to hear a lot .
because i can picture 50 cent have his face melted off and dying . someone kill this loser please !
so many songs for so little a price ! excellent for sitting in that favorite chair on a rainy day with your favorite book ..
dj quik is a great producer , but this album does not show his skills as a rapper . not recommended .
dix put in his work with this album here . he , was really a monster here , this is when ruff riders was making a mark .
this album is good but doesn't have the same excitement as wincing the night away . i don't feel like any songs are particular standouts .
five stars for providing music that relaxes the mind and winds the body down to prepare for sleep and regeneration . recommended for all ages .
the whole entire record is groovy with sweet sounds of the jackson 5 . i love listening to this record especially .
love it ! the lyrics are so fun to sing-along with and the music flows very nicely . one of my new favorites !
this is one of the best sounding discs in my collection . if you like these guys , get this re-release into your collection .
the whole cd is great . reminds me of good friends when we use to listen to this music when it was popular .
i like this song and so does my kids i would recommend it to my friends and their friends too .
i like this song a lot so thank you for having it avalible and thanks for havin a clean version
first and best double disc album ( everybody just has to do one now ) from the greatest rapper of all time .
with only 10 songs on this cd , it can get old quick . however , the songs on the cd are good .
this one best album of the year at the grammy's . if it is best album all year how is it not 5 stars .
what can be said about carly rae jepsen . when she recorded this song it became one of the hottest songs in music history on the planet .
the production on this cd is terrible and so are most of the lyrics , even the dismal w was better then this sh * t
i expected this to be better . it's not a bad album but it's not a big thing . get theoriginal " chronic " than this .
a boy can make you feel beautiful when it comes to courting you and loving you just the way you are physically or personality
buy this cd . excellent . classic . most of the songs on this cd are excellent .
awesome concept and a great way to give the audience more than one side of yourself as an artist .. well done .
excellent album from the king . promise land is a great collection of songs and a very strong album in the legacy of elvis presley .
stevie wonders's high flying musical experimentation and penetrating lyrical insight made innervisions a textured , but never self-indulgent , work of soulful self-discovery .
you would enjoy these women vocals and great songs they made a hit with all time's favorites .. love them to death with their great songs ..
this is one of my all time favorites . grimy production and great lyrics highlight this overlooked release . a definite classic .
this track has all the best ewf songs . good for new fans and those who can't afford to buy all of ewf album's .
i simply just enjoy listening to this song . i didn't know who bruno mars was until i saw him on snl , now im a fan .
a true masterpiece of the greatest raper / actor of all times . inmy opinion only his makaveli : the 7 day theorie-cd is slightlybetter .
such a classic . unforgettable every song just melts in your mind pick this up weather you are a new fonkayeer or ate just funking around
together with the doors , are you experienced , generation terrorist and rage against the machine is this the best debut album i have heard .
big boi album : greatandre please leave this type of music to prince , who's 1000 times better than you , and stick to rap ( you're great )

what a terrific lp . onyx ripped this album . these guys proved why they're still hot in the industry .
oh this gotta be the good life onerepublic is a good artist to listen i would recommend to listen to them !
here is tracy at her best . every song has memorable lyrics and melodies . she outdoes herself in every track . i would highly recommend purchasing this cd !
good album by jadakiss . i think it is his best he needs to drop top 5 dead or alive already.us fans need that about now
it's a little rough unless you enjoy hard rock and heavy metal on a regular basis , good song any way .
this album sounds really good.daryl hall sounds really strong here.the music & writing is good as well.his voice still sounds strong .
this is a bad cd , r kelly is the man . i love this entire cd . i love it , i love it , i love it .

to be honest this is my favorite mary j blige cd hands down to me this is the best album mary j blige ever made in her career

i thoroughly enjoyed this cd . the songs have many memories attached to them . it has made an excellent addition to my collection of music .
this is the only sade album you'll ever need . great from beginning to end .
i give ' odd couple ' 4 1/2 stars as it is a unique feel good cd that can cross various music genres .
love it ! we played this for christmaswon't get tired doing so ! after all it's all worth it ! winter-spring-summer-fall ! veterans day or not !
friend turned me on to this music , fell in love with jazz listening to this guy and some of his friends .
this album is coo . i liked it . for anyone who likes dj screw this is the next generation . get it !
stevie doing what he does best : writing meaningful lyrics and memorable melodies . i highly recommend this cd for older and newer fans ! enjoy !
diva is another top 20 all time cd for me , if i had to go to an island with only a few cds , this would be one .
dis some funkaaaay shizzizzle dawg , yall be trippin if y'aint down ! smoke fat , listen loud ! love
but definately good enough to have in your collection . it starts really strong but after track 7 or 8 goes downhill
i don't like most of katy perry's music , but this song is fun to have in my playlist for exercise . it's up-tempo and energizing .
different it was ok and really don't have much else to say about it . curious to read other reviews . review away !
absorbing feature introduction to one of modern rock's most promising indie upstarts , dy is afforded a more natural fluidity later consciously challenging material can elude .
put this on the hi-fi , pour yourself and your loved one a large glass of red wine . sit back and enjoy .
2 1/2 overpraised as a staple of underground hip hop , keith's delivery of science-sexy nonsense can be entertaining but grew stale along with the 90 ' s beats .
this is a good cd . the standouts are man enough and spanish guitar . this cd does not really live up to what potential she has .
have over 5,000 holiday mp3 files ( obviously i collect them ) and this one seems to barely fit the genre . at least it was free .
well my ex has this cd and i liked it so i had to get my own , and found it at the right price .
the best rap album of 2006 . buy the cd and keep clipse in the rap game .
another strong album from shakira . i would rate this as slighly less then " laundry service " but still an enjoyable album worht listening too .
i like there early stuff and this one is a good one too . i like the poster and the album .
i love me some jill scott , i will never get tired of this cd . the entire cd is awesome . i love it .
i give andre props for being original but im just not feeling what he's become . big boi's cd is the reason for the 2 stars .
i could just listen to this over and over ! ( ... and sometimes i do ! ) easy download from amazon .
this album is easy listening . i listened to the tracks before purchasing and i was confident in getting it . great album !
why ? another album by juel is as necessary as spending time writing this review . gotta go ! ! !
beautiful ... gorgeous ... exquisit ... decadent ... just what you'd expect from the godess of popular music
this is what all of us were waiting for ... the game spits fire ... undoubtedly the best album of 2005
joan baez was one of the good folk singers and song against the ways that were wrong in the world back in the 60 ' s
a new one for me , but not too much of a stretch . this cd is a feel good kind . you did good boys .
early mobb , but still an enjoyable listen . " hit it from the back " classic song from hav & p . overall its a a -
i think overall this cd besides untouchable is face's best work ! 4.5 mics in the source . it's like that !
nice to hear different versions of their songs to dance and sing to ... always kinda dance , techno group so the remixes make sense
this young sista brings music back to the scene . this cd is truly a must have . alicia does it again ...
come on i undstand not liking mike jones beacuse he sounds like a parrot but you can't review an album if youu haven't listened to it !
this was originally a gift from my first " boyfriend " and it brings back good , and some not-so-good , memories from high school . good music .
what a great album . classic 80 ' s music a great collection for heart . if you like heart 80 ' s music you will love this album
bruno can find better songs instead of sings like this sting type song . some people should stay away from yell singing songs .
usually i like what you call " neo-soul " . this artist reminds me a bit of nicolette . but for me this is too less song and melody ...
duffy sounds so cool . she is brash and bluesy and totally enjoyable . the album has a fabulous dark blues club feel to the whole thing .
get it because this is the 2nd best solo wu album behind raekwon - only built for cuban linx
excellent ! ! ! this phil collins best song highly recommend buying awesome best know the miami vice scene defiantly get this and watch that ! ! !
i like this album . it's a really mournful collection of songs . i don't listen to it much anymore because her music is over played on the radio .
i enjoyed this cd a long time ago , in high school and just never got around to buying it . great cd and i love teedra's vocals .
different version of this holiday classic . i love the ukulele , but i have not ever heard it in a christmas carol .
this ep set the tone for all of the off album release the whigs were to release ... covers playing on dulli's menacing crooner image .
love bruno mars . so very talented on so many artistic levels . his voice is so raw and amazing and this song is no exception to his skills .
i love this cd , like bowie always on mutations , that was the last for my duran duran collection , enjoy it .
iz this da lil slim dat use 2 b in cash money ? ? ?
i agree with " shawnna's number one fan " this cd definitely put her foot in the game ... even though she's always been there !
it has a nice combo of regular katy perry and some rap . i prefer this version over the one without juicy j .
this is great , unique tune . i'm addicted . lorde should be successful for a long time if she keeps up the creativity .
another disappointment . the only good thing on the cd is " too many walls " ... besides that , the cd is pretty much not good for much .
if you want a coaster to rest your beer cans on so your table doesn't get a nasty circular stain on it.protect your table .
boring ! when has sheryl crow ever played it safe ? it's like she did'nt even try !
of course keith sweat music sounds good . i love just about all of his cds .
this is adele adkins second album and her best . i love her . i hope the quality of her future albums lives up to this one .
mobb deep is the all time kings of thug ! buy this album , if not buy some one are some body thats fake !
stylez is deep likez ... he's ill ! ! ! i cant wait 4 he's new album like ... d block ! ! !
rufus was a funk band and played great music and having chaka with them was key to their success ; enjoyable .
of the ten van halen albums i have , this is probably my least favorite . really a one-hit wonder .
sounds more like the classics and what have you . i'm soothed by these guys , everytime.no lyrics , but poetry just the same .
this is fiona apple's most famous album , and for good reason . it is beautiful and weird just like she is . listen to this .
further seems forever is awesome and if you liked showoff check out chris from showoffs new band farewell my enemy at [ ... ] they are really f'n awesome.tom
it's a good cleaning the house cd .. if you know what i mean .. wink wink
alice cooper's 3rd release is more in the vein that he would follow throughout his career . the songs are a little more contemporary but still full of alice .
this is a great song . it has an interesting sound to it and i've always liked the group that sings it .
at its best ! ! ! i love this album havent listened to it in a while but it is good overalllyrics 8/ 10 beats 9/10
bad religion proves their worthiness once again with that signature sound we've grown to love . get up and wiggle ... they've done it again ... ! ! !
this version was the best one i could find that still stayed true to the original song i heard and enjoyed .
who is mike jones ? one look at his lyrics should answer that question .
i think this album is great and love the pop / hip hop hybrid , but admit that it is not for everyone .

what else can we say but this is a fun song that is lovely to dance to for people of all ages .
it is great . love the lyrics and the beat .. bruno mars did an awesome song as usual .. one of the top songs on my playlist
very few bands personify 80s new wave music more than the cure . this is a great compilation . if you like new wave this is a must have .
i love the chorus ! i love the verses ! i love the black eyed peas ! i love this song ! i love !
it has the song " little wing " , nothing else needs to be said .
she sounds what can only be described as virgin country . pure and wholesome an it gave ai a shot in the arm which it so desperately needed .
don't get me wrong and don't call me maybe for free ... this was free and nice to have in my collection .
not maany people like this album like i do i thinks it was asign of things to come.one of the best debuts
what's better than mcknight and groban ? not much ! makes listening to a favorite christmas carol as warm as a winter fire .
in my opinion , this is luda at his best ! a great cd !
great , easy-listening classic rock sound . this is my favorite cd of this band.not a classic , but songs to definitely remember !
this has got to be his best collection . lots of memories listening to this one . all good ones . great sound .
this is another example of ville valo and the group at their finest and most talented moments . 5 star rating -
this ain't nuthin special , afew hot tracks but most of it is trash.hot tracks : bad boy for lifecan't believeback for good now
ever ! great tunes like the title song , james dean , old 55 ... classics ! skip the " greatest hits " and just get this album .
this is my third favorite song right now and my umpteenth happy purchase meaning amazon.com is the best website i have ever bought stuff from thank you amazon
if you area five finger death punch then you'll love this cd . it is amazing . sound is a very good mixdown .
my children picked 10 songs each to put together a dance cd and this was one of the songs that made the list . keeps them moving !
this is a beautiful song from adele's first album . everything she touches turns to gold . beautiful voice and beautiful song .
listening to music like this on my computer makes my day at work much better , and this was perfect for that purpose .
break it yourself is an absolutely gorgeous record definitely beyond what even expected from andrew bird , i'd say it's well worth adding to your music collection .
bruno mars is a genius and this song is proof of it . the song has this old yet new vibe if that makes any since
neil sedaka singing a christmas song - - who can resist ? for the holiday season , i recommend this selection for everyone's library .
elton john / madman across the water : there is not a bad track on this excellent album and it more than earns a five star rating .
i hate e - 40 , but the track with 2 pac is good.the 2 stars are only for that song.don ' t buy this junk trust me .
i can't stop listening to this . much softer than their last album but still kicks butt . i think this band may just be the new queen .
starts off strong but definitely fades during the final tracks . overall though , it's still a pretty solid album and was well worth paying 4 dollars for .
this is a good solid album . it doesn't quite live up to the 2 prior so i can't give it 5 stars but still a nice work .
one of eagles classic albums . brings back great memories . whats not to like and the price is great as well .
the music down loaded really well . i was just hoping this was the longer version of the song but it is still good !
nothing like a sweet voice to stop road rage . how can you get angry listening to something so mellow ! ! ! sweet
i like being able to download only the songs i like instead of buying a whole cd and when you dowload , its instant gratification ! !
such a great artist , and an amazing group one of my favs of all time . a must own for music lovers
i like 50 cent and this album better than curtis album dont like have a baby by me though
this is an aight lp and it's nothing that typical or political and its change from those type stuff so i guess i can deal with the dipset
saw the parody of the song and knew that i had to have the original song . bright and fun is the name of this song
thanks for the speedy service ! too bad this wasn't thrice @ their best - - i can't stand the first 3 discs .
this cd is banging from start to finish . a few of the hooks stopped me from giving it 5 stars but this is a must have
this is an excellent jewel cd . she delivers her sharp lyrics and excellent melodies in her typical manner . i would highly recommend this cd !
fast , funny and joyously hooky , last splash captures what alternative rock was supposed to sound like before it degenerated into plain-wrap radio mush .
this song is cool , i sing it cause it's cheesy and it should be sung because it's cheesy music with friends
i really like this song . totally glad i added this to my mp3 cloud collection . will have to check out more of their stuff .
this goes much beyond the pigeonhole . beyond in musicianship , certainly better vocals , more interesting arrangements , far more listenable . hope they continue .
the bad boy himself at his best . this is a must have collection . miss me blind is my favorite , followed closely by church of the poison mind
i am ' older ' and like to keep up with some of the alternative tunes . my daughter recommended these artist and i was quickly hooked .
i'm a big fan of the band expose there cd what you don't know is an excellent cd , all the songs sound great there really cool .
this is a super nice album . this is the kind of music that will never get old . you can't lose by having this album in your collection .
the song is sweet and fun . i feel anyone who likes pop and justin timberlake in general will enjoy this song .
the american drug association should use this album to deter kids from drugs . it would work alot better than mcgruff
i like all of alicia's music . she is just a really good singer and her songs are just super nice to listen to .
reminds me so much of college days in massachussetts ! love this cd ! it's raw and fine tuned . great music ~
common tell me the truth if you hear this in todays world youdo not have that patients to sit and listen to it all i gotto say 2004 .
love to listen to him during my club days he was one of the top sellers during the house music era
i would like to see a biography on him . i guarantee it's amazing . his story from the real atl to word of mouf is really inspirational .
this is real rap , not commercial . true classic and should be kept 5 stars . sog for life .
no , not that otis , but the real mccoy ! raw power in his voice and no one can beat him at the blues !
i loved the cars , soooo oringinal.the more time passes , the better they are.and this is the set of songs that launched the legendary band .
but she's great . my favorite song on this album is sinkin soon . get this album if you enjoy jazz and previous norah albums .
anthony hamilton once again proves to be great . you will love this recording and play it over and over . enjoy it
if fifty cent is bigger than the beatles and the beatles are bigger than jesus , is fifty cent bigger than jesus ?
call this one " bodge on boogie " because its that good , folks ! now you know ...
i had never heard of them before but tried it out and it was really great . i would look for more from them .
i got this track because it was free and to be honest i liked it thought that mr . lamar really stuck his foot in this one
this is a great song but i think it it too long at six minutes . the lyrics are lacking but the beat is catchy for a dance song .
3 1/2 one of few effective electronic-indie collaborations , gu is an effectively solid piece of emo boogie , somewhat hampered nonetheless from limited but appealing production .
face top 5 rappers dead or alive and this album proves that ... also check out the diary , the fix & mr scarface is back
thank god black rob is in prison another bad boy artist has bit the dust heard g dep's somewhere struing out anyway black rob's cd sucks .

this album has all of the classic hits , plus turn your love around . a must buy for old and new fans .
they are two musicians who have collaborated on numerous songs.the perfect guitarist and the perfect folk singer ! their great harmonies makes this the best cd
what can i say ... its another great album by luda ... still putting that fire out with the banging beats and dope lyrics .
hey , anyone who puts in david boreanaz in their video automatically gets high praise ! good job , dido !
i love this song it is one of my favorites ! ! listen to it all the time when the mood is right !
tired of this song . hate it ! why do we americans support artists who sing about hating our soldiers and killing them . why ?
nas is the illest rapper . 50 cent should take notesinstead of talking trash on sirius radio . g unot ! ! !
good songs but you really need the funk on fire cd set for more of the best funk group in ohio at the time .
black korea is hot and the overall la riots experience on wax is very evident . a mind blowing rap album ! ! !
pure history . this album opened the collective white consciousness to the stark depths of the blues . not to be missed .
what can i say about the queen of soul , aretha franklin other than her music will go on in time and have an affect on future generations .

love this song ! downloaded this for my ringtone was super easy to get on my phone and use . will download from amazon again super easy .
every song is good . vol 1 had almost all of the big hits but these songs are all good.these are the lesser known hits .
i have been in awe of adele since her first album 19 , and i think 21 is her best yet . the cd arrived on time and intact .
it was ok . it wasn't good as the other cd's that he came out with , but it was alright . solid !
not too late by norah jones is just a good album to listen to over and over again trust me you want get tired of listening .
bad music , by a bad man . my wife made me buy this for her .
harper's roots-rock was starting to atrophy and show generic influence , but still guarantees the disc is not dismissed by a decent number of sincerely rendered compositions .
this cd is a very good showing of michelle's talents and i love it . the spirit room though a good cd was topped by this cd .
just one listen to on the rolling stone web site as a free listen and i was hooked , best album of 2011 .
one of michael's best cd's . i purchased this one for myself , but i bought another one for my sister as well . she really enjoyed this one .

i did not own anything by fleetwood mac , but remember their songs from college . this is perfect and i love all of the songs . highly recommend .
some ha-ha-funny stuff . a lot of juvenile stuff . nothing of real quality . pass .
the songs arent as catchy as his debut but the synth work and melodies are just as strong . the music speaks for itself , try it out for yourself
my wife and kids love this disc . we have listened to it in the car many times . very strong disc as the awards would indicate .
dmx is one of the greatest rappers of all time and this album proves it , he's grimy and straight up , he's the real deal .

a klassic great second album including last word keep ya head upone of the best in 94 .
this in an excellent moody blue's cd . these are nice melodies and sounds . very enjoyable . i would highly recommend buying this cd for your collection !
3 1/2 retains an entrancing atmosphere of creepy but fun ambition , if unable to seal the whole deal with an uneven package .
only someone with a lot of talent would dare use one name . incredible . love the tunes , the artist and the way it all comes together .
chris has the gift of gab and his beats are on point in this album . this is a true growth from rapper to complete artist .
this is not old school , it is for the young and energy driven . good dance music not just for listening .

i love this band they get better and better finally a new school band with a good messege amazing
i love this song - it's full of energy and the music is very catchy . great vocals and a consistent sound .
got it free , nice sound and easy listening . just was average when compared too some of the other authors my wife likes to hear .
great to jam too . but she usually has fun music for a car ride or whatever . i'm not worried about controversy , just fun music
not a bad track to listen too . i always love amazon free tracks . i like discovering new music on here , this song is no exception .
jazzy , groovy and crunk best describes this joint . check it out ! key tracks : back in the daydangerbump iti want youlove of my life

perfectly performing short-length warm up to an embraced debut , yl showed the unique indie experimenters firing on all cylinders from the start .
i really really enjoyed this album , some great songs nothing mind blowing but a solid album , i would highly recommend it
vocals are entrancing . i like the slow jam vibe of the song . i listen to it often and it was a good free find .
another album that should be considered one of his best , and one of the better albums of the late 1970s ... a truly magical album

i believe this is my favorite cd . this cd has excellent lyrics and a great beat . i highly recommend it.writer at bellaonline
this album is a solid production by an older , more mature no doubt . their sound has aged and not in a bad way .
next to the immaculate studio releases this can't help but look like a ragged b-sides compilation with more than a couple reminders as to why his strings were king .
really impressed . great production . i didn't have to hit the skip button once ! mary brought the pain on this one !
great song , wonderful voice , catchy tune , what is not to love , add the cloud and a portable device and you are good to go .
if this is your kind of music it's great stuff . unfortunately i'm more into metal so this really isn't my thing .
mystikal sounds good on every track.my fav tracks are there he go , and im on fire . a must have for any rap fan .

i freakin love this album . its nice fun music . im glad the 80s are back .
i really enjoy this cd it is a lot different to his first cd all the tracks are great . his tilled track is fantastic .
a great performer , writer and ballardeer . this is a great cd as i have often played it through the midnight hours to great enjoyment .
steeper , breezier arrangements on bl compliments his other bare-bones melancholia , rarely smothering the elemental sadness and acoustic excellence prevalent in near everything drake composed .
another great hank iii album . contains some awesome traditional sounding country songs . it's such a shame that country music doesn't sound like this anymore .
i nice burst onto the scene . i like this from ludacris . pretty ill .
i love marsha ambrosius's music . i listen to her cd all of the time . i like her solo and also like her with floetry .
this is by far my favorite cd - - ever . i don't like hip hop , or rap--but santigold has a different ethnically jammin sound .
i've said it once , i've said it twice , and i'll say it thrice : this woman's voice is horrible !
great cd in true dido fashion . if you liked no angel , this cd will not dissapoint . i listen to this cd all of the time .
great album , all the songs in this album are great , i recommend this album to everyone ! ! ! a must buy ! ! !
excellent cd for the sound track that went alone with movie . the dance groves really get you moving even today
enuff said right there but since i have to have a certain number of words , i'll reiterate . it's earth wind & fire ...
tightly knit , no-frills progressive rock from the usually overly sensational 70 ' s-era italians is classy compositional ambition and arranged restraint .
i love anything joe makes . i am currently buying all his old cd's and his new one . can't wait to download it . * * )
ja rule is a freakin disgrace to the rap game ! anybody who buys his album needs their head checked !
as always , h . i . m . produces beautiful music and emotional lyrics that compliment each other-outstanding record ! 5 star rating -
i purchased this for my teenager who seems to like it . i listened to it and it sounds ok .
i brought it for one song but find the whole cd to be entertaining , the cd is worth the money
i really don't like this song . voice cracks too much when saying keep keep bleeding .
no doubt that you can't go wrong with no doubt we own all their music and even when she went solo ... glad they are back together
a saturday was always complete when this music would come on my tv set.herbie hancock brought the jams with this set.alot of fun & slammin good times .
it may be a good song to others depending on the genre of music you like but it just wasn't my thing .
this is a good effort from orbital , otono is the best on the album .
jack white pumps out great albums left and right . he could record himself taking a * * * and it would sell .

lacey knocked it out the park again a combination of spiritual uplifting and dark gothic sounds with a voice that is distinguishable anywhere .

that song gangstas make the world go round , alone is reason to buy this cd .
pretty funny song , though should have let rebecca black sing in it . my gf loves this song . entertaining , interesting , pop
even with colors threatening to leave a poor aftertaste , sanders charts his own love supremely with an enveloping spiritual homage of whirling tribute .
songs in the key of life is wonderful , perhaps the best 5 albums ever . stevie wonder is a genius .
i used to have this on lp and i new it was a good album so i wanted the cd .
one of the best album of q ! the personnel is really great ! and here there is the legendary ... killer joe !
this is one of the most powerful cds ever recorded , and i wish the band would just re-unite because their subsequent material is uncomparable
nowhere near as good as their debut , but a good album from them ... couldn't see them top their debut anyways :)
ludacris represented with this one . i love this cd its off the chains . good beats , original lyrics , everything needed to make a cd great .
i just purchased this song as an mp3 and i am very satisfied with it.the sound quality is excellent and i am most pleased with it .

i enjoyed his stuff with gensis and his own . this is for any who like peter gabriel stuff and music .
you can't have a good r & b collection without mr redding . this pretty much is a good sampling of his talent .
considering the loss and tragedy within the band , this is a very strong , if not stunning release by the pretenders and some of their best material !
this is true alison . this is true bluegrass . this is a wonderful cd !
i enjoy listening to this song . it always puts me in a good mood . her music is very calming and relaxing .

this song is a nice relaxing christmas song with no words to it . good for when you are having a dinner party or just need some chill time
this is a great classic album . my only complaint is that it would be so much better in stereo ( it's a mono recording ) .
i don't find it as triumphant as the follow-up , but barely a more creative , organic hip-hop album was released then ( or now ) .
this is an average album . there are some decent songs and the production is okay . probably for die hard ghost fans.rating c +
angie stone's deep vocals are moving . the songs have messages . i love the first intro cut . angie stone is soul
godsmack best one they done . all 12 kicks major ass . buy this one you'll love it .
fantastic wish museum , because it is what i feel i entered when listingin to these steller songs by la krause ! ! !

this is the worst jay-z album that he came out with . listen to some real stuff like pac
i love this song , i love maroon 5 too , their music has such an upbeat feeling to them . love it !

blue orchid is a great song but the rest of the album sux ... the songs are kinda weird .
i waited awhile for letoya and latavia to come back . letoya made it so worth it . she did a great job with her first solo effort .
steely dan has been around for a long time , but they've also not been given the credit they deserve . atleast i don't think .
this is my favorite redman album , he just kills it on muddy waters . the skits on this record are highlarious too .

both my kids had this song after i heard it i had to get it . my first lmineers song . i will be listening to them .
what more can i say , this album is a total package.tracks such as ' change your world ' best define the direction in which soul music must go
4 1/2 where else do you get the pop prowess of the beatles mixed with the funk finesse of parliament in such solid servings ?
this one still sounds the best to me of all his other release.your bodys callin , bump & grind , 12 play.he is a very talented writer & producer .
great album , heavy riffs , great enchanting lyrics and amazing vocals . go cult !
the musicianship is still solid , but the whole cd just feels kind of cold .
i wasnt really into 80 ' s rap but this is pretty good , but anyway get it !
i don't get it why some people rated this album 1 star . this is such a good album . the beats for this album are great . g-unit .
dock of the bay what a song this man was great its sad his life was short he really kicked it out
excellent new music for my collection . loved that i got the cd for my son and i got an mp3 version for myself .
fair , but no better than fair . the lead singer obviously was heavily inspired by belinda carlisle . it's worth a listen at least .
good album busta ... i love this album ! nite time beats for a system great album and a must buy ! ! !
good lyrics and accompanying music . love the words which are easy to relate to . one of this artists best songs
the title song is a classic . the overall feel of the album is what you would expect from any of the eagles .
love love love this album ! ! maxwell's sexy and sensual voice and vibe are so clearly evident here in every song .
this cd is a gamble & huff production . the jacksons were very lucky to get these philly greats .
always good to hear from this group ! debbie harry's vocals remain strong and consistent over the years . can't beat the price of free either !
the fact that the third cd has say , say , say on it make it alright . the disc is awesome anyway .
this is i think one of mary j's best albums but at the same time she has so many but i consider this one a must have .
the name bone thugs n harmony speaks for it self every album they ever made was wak ! ! ! ( and thug world order is no exception )
if you only had to own one cd of jimi hendrix this one would be it ... " if 6 was 9 " baby .
i listen 2 about all the songs on this cd wich means this is a pretty good cd
love this band . this song is just one more good song in a long list . i would recommend it and its album .
this song has clear , sharp vocals with an addictive melody . just what one would want in an entertaining pop song .
well , i call it operatic . i love his singing . it is just so amazing . it is a song you can hear again and again .
no diss but its ok but his music is repetitive to me but i do like it
adele is so talented . it seems like this song was made just for her . i am not sure any else could sing it the way she does .
the sound quality is superior and the classic teddy voice is strong and soulful .. highly recommended .
good cd . really different . this album has a sound never heard in the rock genre . its amazing . im speechless .
classic ! go get it support real rap music . production off the chain lyrics you already haft to know he brings it .
love this sond , billy's sound and the words of this song . it's how i feel and it's put in a non offensive way .
i have his greatest hits cd with this song on it and the original one from the cassette to . classic
i like this song just as i love his break out hit called locked out of heaven that i have too
not an album for the meek . jadakiss pulls no punches , shoots no blanks , and leaves no target standing .
was a very entertaining cd liked mostly all of it , did not like their earlier music , great dance music . was happy with my purchase .
fozzy blows this out of the water ... all that remains reloaded is a similar vibe , but far more original with better hooks .
this song has a memorable melody and lyrics . rack city is a classic example of that bay area hyphy sound .
soothing melody and great song for relaxation yet it is not bland or boring in any way . i enjoy it .
the whining in this song makes me crazy . it sounds like coldplay's chris martin getting raped in a maximum security prison shower . a-awe-awe-all ! terrible !
what a cd . there is alittle something for everyone on this new must have release . she hasn't lost a thing .
a great introduction to frank sinatra . fabulous tunes compiled together sung in only frank sinatra's way .
encore doesnt get get the props it deserves . one of my favorite albums ever . its a deep album and genius .
the first 5 songs are as good as anything they have ever done , but the album drops after that and is only somewhat interesting .
horrible from start till finsihtheir are only 3 songs i likeother than that this album should'vebeen shelved .
this cd arrived flawless if not perfect ! the sound & quality of music is amazing & highly recommendpurchasing this if you are a bobby caldwell fan ! jj
i like this techno beat . the song is good too . i appreciate the strong woman factor . women don't feel like they have any power in a relationship
basically a bunch of classic tupac songs with wack beats ! do not waste your time this cd is horrible ! the originals are way better
boss of al bosses cd ridin every track is def 5 star album for real dont sleep on it ...
perfect music for working out ! all her songs have strong meanings and really pump you up to complete your exercise entirely
for peple tht love the carpenters , this is it good songs that wee hits all of the songs is my favor . go bu it !
just some more white boys who can't rap any plenty of white fansto buy there albums
delivery b + lyrics a + production astyle a + consistensy a + overall a
this song is so beautiful and uplifting ! i highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be at peace and stay calm .
what a great song . i put this on repeat . then i broke down and bought the album . i was not disappointed .
this album is very unique . postal service has a similar sound to modestmouse , airand the shins and that stuff , its very good . a must buy
who can make a cd better than kells ? this is an oldie but as with all of them its a goodie ...
3 1/2 alluring , hushed folk can become muddled in repetitious acoustic phrasings throughout the entire course , but remains strong track-by-track if nothing more than for sincere delivery .
i was looking for a classic sound , not what i was hoping for . but would recommand to a friend or family member
3 1/2 endearing side project debut which benefited from the unique moog / male-female / rock dynamic quickly sputtered out after they initially returned .
i love the song , it is a great song to make you feel beautiful . would recommand to a friend or family member
this song is clean and positive . nice change with a lot of other stuff on the radio that isn't always nice .
this is the it band now getting a lot of radio play . a good breakout cd . i would try more of their cds
1984 it doesn't seem possible that it was that long ago that these songs were recorded . they are true van halen .
great album by a great band ! brings back fond memories of my younger years . not a single bad or mediocre song on it !
this is a fun collection of music . cyndi lauper is a gem and she makes a good addition of my collection of era music .
one of the best cd's this year . he is like a mini new edition getting started , menus the other four guys .
dmx had a cool album with this one . this was a tight album and if you don't got get it.the tightest song it party up .
the music of the eagles takes me back to some of the best times of my youth . nostalgia rules , especially great when driving for some reason !
these guys were like a cigarette after really wild make up sex who can complain about that i wonder , and who would ? not this guy .
i got this song because i liked beyonce . she didn't disappoint me . her song is inspiring and recommend it to everyone .
my favorite tracks are " gotta be a leader " " the future " .
once ranked the greatest album of all time - i think it's a solid 9 and love the beach boys sound - but goat i would disagree .
inspiring rock-funk rarely deteriorates into extended-jamland , instead winding tight layers of gospel-thrust into their own special brand of righteous rock and roll .
never really heard this until i got it of cloud player , but it does have a catchy beat so you may or may not like it ! !
the albun is already jamming . the last song on this album is a x-mas song . sraight up pimpish to the tee ! ! !
don't buy this cd you need to buy that new bone thugs thats cd is of the hook .
it's simon & garfunkel . this isn't my favorite album , but it is close . and anytime i am listening to them is a good time .
i'm never disappointed to hear this song and i don't think i've ever skipped it . reminds me of my mentor , who passed before this song came out .
incredible album . i am completely in love with the crazy lyrics and music . it feels like you're in a sexy circus , but in a good way .
i don't really like when old artists come back out because then can't really deliver but combining brandy with chris brown yessss good job
decent song but it can get old fast . i love the band but my kids played it way too much over a week
wow , fabulous debut album for a young girl ! i really miss her music and i treasure this album . it's my favorite fiona album .
the song desperado is what turned me on to the eagles in the early 70 ' s and just wanted to have the album again
really beautiful singer , i wish she would be more recognised . the production by mtume is funky and beautiful . what a great singer
this is a really good greatest hits compilation . i love it and the cover design is awesome too . eagles rock !
i purchased this cd although i am not a big carly simon fan . but i must admit that this cd contains some good music .
there is nothing by bruno mars that i don't like . he continues to amaze with his voice , his skill , and his ongoing talents .
very good copy . you'll like this song . i'm sure you've heard it a thousand times . this one's a keeper . yay
what more needs to be said about this album ? it's good , enough said .
i love the west side story connection in the lyrics of the songs from school's out . this is classic material from one of the best .
one of the best bands , emcees , producers and albums ever . no one can even compare . get yourself a copy . you'll like it .
why in god's name is plant doing this . this music is terrible . for god's sake call call up jimmy page and leave krauss in a ditch somewhere .
love this track added it to my exercise playlist so i can dance while i get my burn on . sometimes the dance is the exercise . enjoy
classic elton john . probably his best collection of songs along with " yellow brick road " . these songs never get old . a must .
this new ja rule album is awful . he gets progressively worse with each effort-somebody please stop the madness .
this is classic michael - before all the drama and plastic surgery . brings back childhood memories and brings a smile to your face .
bobby caldwell's what you won't do for love is one of the best love songs of the 1970 ' s . this album should have gotten more exposure .
rating because love the song hear it at work almost every event but mostly at weddings great line dancing song like everything about it for people who love the song
another excellent release of the 90 ' s by rush.standout tracks like animate , cut to the chase , speed of love & everyday glory highlight this album .
great cd . any paul simon fan should have this one . creative and well written and consistent . run that body down and papa hobo are my favorites .
i found this song while looking for an other song and played it and loved it now i lissen to it all the time
not a katy perry fan , but i do like this song . some find inspiration in the lyrics . i think it is a good song .
i really like the song ... he has a great voice ... you can't help but , like the music .. now i have the added bonus of cloud .
how many more britney wannabe's can we stand come on now , when will this pop stuff end .
great solid cd but some songs were boring but this cd is crazy and i cant wait till detox .
this group is new to me . i learn of them on american idol last season.this is my favorite song ... also like decode .
from the objective reviewer ... a great overview , but too much missing to be called completely satisfying . he just cannot be reduced to two cds .
great album ! what a great short lived power trio.just the names of west , bruce and laing says it all ! !
there are some catchy tunes on here , but as a whole , i can't listen to the whole album without jumping around tracks .
really good songs i associate with my youth . brings back memories . enjoyed some differences in performing old favorites . these folks are magical together .
rap music may have it's followers , and it may well even have produced somegenuinely decent artists and worthwhile albums.this isn't one of them . pass .
the christmas season invites so much good music , and greensleeves is a classic example . listen to it while you decorate .
jimmy buffett has left by all means left his mark in the music world . his music is obviously known all over the world and just keeps going .
i really like rod stewart's cover of broken arrow but i much prefer robertson's version and it means even more when you know he wrote it .
glad to have neil back , and these are great songs from one of my favorite singers .
absolutely love jb - music , lyrics famastic . jb can park his things undermy bed anytime :) ! wish is to have the complete jb collection !
this is one of steely dan's best efforts in my opinion . a great addition to any fan's collection .
this is another cd i nearly wore out . this is good stuff . henley got the lyrics going . and great music .
i loved a few rlj songs over the years and loved pop pop ... but this anthology reminds me of her artistry in a new way ... poet .
some songs are good , but most of them are not . i just don't like it .
i've enjoyed this song since my teens in the 70 ' s and glad to have it as mp3 . it's still a " happening " tune today !
a very summery record in my opinion . i don't like to play this out of the summer months
i love this song so much . nicki minaj is awesome and her music is always so touching . i recommend this song .

really love this song a very catchy song to sing to a real must to have on your playlist on your mp3 player
what a gifted tony ! this rendition is one of the besti found ! get one for yourself , you won'tget tired of it.promise !
a whimsical ditty about the jolly old elf who brings gifts to good girls and boys . i enjoyed listening to this .
great album from scc , bring it on is bang'd out { shouts to all the loc sets } . g stories ... the whole album .
i gave this cd four out of five stars because although it has some good songs on it , ultimately it's not my favorite style of music .
here is craig david's second album , nice work for a sophmore album . i wish he got more praise because it is definately deserved .
can't remember what this is or when i bought it lol , but im sure its good because i don't buy crap lol .
debut from these aussies is a very strong album , trojans , symptoms , electric are my favorites good , dancable beats , captures their talent , which is considerable
great song and enjoyable to listen to . i am a big fan of bruno mars and really like his music . great buy .
besides the big hit this album is really fun and amazing . they do a nice job of balancing fun loving and meloncoly
hudson's voice is fabulous . she really gets to sing and show it off on this cd . a big talent .
of course what's not to love . this is mjb ! i love her music .
a must have . the 2 big hits american pie and vincent , but the rest is good too !
this albums continue's a string of incredible albums from one of the decade's best song writersbravo !
jeezy is sick , especially the joint mr . 17.5 and hypnotize are hot . buy the album
sm provide quality-esque , lips-like alterna-pop with plenty of mysti-sheen production smothered on to elevate much of the writing past its derivative nature into something way more background-savvy-sexy .
blips bleeps more bleeps assorted blips yawns double-yawns scratchy samples of crackling record grooves plaintive yelps blips blippingtons tones scattershot ersatz poetry bleeps bleepings blah humbuglove , hamburg
vinny paul , drummer dime bag would be so proud r . i . p . dime great album great musicians loved it buy it
mono adds a eurotrash element to their cliched chick vocaled electronica , there ain't nothing exciting here , go buy another portishead album instead .
a great album for long drives . got this after hearing them on the radio and i don't regret it for a second .
some great guitar work , but its hard to listen to this band a lot . i don't think this is their best album .
this is murderous j back saying that this is the best cd ever . i would give it a 6 but i cant .
i'm not sure how long these guys have been around but being a lover of southern blues , i love it ! !
after the noise filled pscychocandy comes the starkly lovely darklands . the jmc layers acoustic guitars with electric and brings off an album that is haunting and beautiful .
i really like her voice.although the song was over played on the radio as of late , it is still a good song .
this chili peppers best album song-wise and singing-wise . john frusciante hasn't gotten back in guitar-playing shape on this one , but it's still a must-have album .
this band has one of the most original sounds out there , all their albums are incredible . i'm glad they're finally being recognized for all their hard work .
i love this song she way cool it a very cool video too inspirational very cool . reminds me of the aliens .
for the price i paid , this was a steal ... great raps awsome beats , perfect for the car ... just don't get pulled over
i enjoyed her 80 ' s 90 ' s and now music . this one is a good one to get if you like her music .
it is a much , much shorter version than i expected . would have liked it better if it was like the radio edit .
have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazellove this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of us .
need i say more they were the perfect match for the movie , i wish more would match up the way these guys did ...
pitbull and ke $ ha could this song get more of a beat to it . i doubt it . love it to death .

ornette coleman is a genius.this album is fantastic from start to finish.ornette & group sound incredible here.the music here has alot of color & texture .

tihs compaltaion got my into prince and is a strong greatest hits displaying prince's artitist genuis . great collection but old prince is always good
i like the music to this song ; it's very upbeat and great to work out to also . ellie goulding has a great voice .

youngbloodz has produced another tight album . you can listen to this cd from top to bottom without skipping any tracks
this is an okay album by elton john , not great , but some nice music on it . does not challenge honky chateau or goodbye ybr .
" stand and deliver " and " antmusic " are surrounded by absolute dreck . beyond that , there are some good songs , but nothing on that level .
elvis costello had gotten us used to better than this . this is around the era when i started to lose interest in him completely .
