great little item to organize your cd's in a binder for a presentation orsimply to secure them for storage .
these labels are excellent to use for shipping . print the address using your printer and they are ready to go . no hassle and easy to use .
writes smoothly on a whiteboard , and even more impressive erases well . the cleaning solution doesn't smudge the ink too much .
i sell and mail a lot of things . these are the perfect size . really good envelopes . also , i trust the scotch brand .
item arrived as described . i love the bold neon colors ! being that they are sharpie and permanent markers makes them even better .
i purchased this box of prismacolor premier ebony graphite sketching pencil , jet black for everyday drawing , and drawing class with quick-sketch . good product .
this is pretty good ink . in a proper printer ( not canon ) this ink is actually good . it comes out vivid and clear .
they are dividers , so you can only say so much about them but they worked well for my purposes and i liked the colors .
came fast love this prints great this was well packed . i had no problems installing this was easy . a must for the holidays
this is what you need for printing . they are so small . there just is not much ink . they work well but they don't last long .
the reinforced tabs on these folders make them extra strong . these are highly recommended if you file documents regularly ( over the standard type ) .
great for hiding keys . this provides box makes it easy to store a key in or under anything metal .
i was very pleased with this product and the price . i received it promptly . i usually buy paper from walmart but glad i bought this one .
love having tape that adheres so well and looks almost invisible when applied . i use this product very often and very pleased with it .
i had no problems at all with this gadget . theres a good selection of phrases and languages and i could see it coming in handy on vacations .
these tabs are great . not cheap quality . goes great in binders to keep papers organized . very good for office use .
great quality paper . works fine with both our hp and canon printers . i am very pleased . you can't go wrong with this paper .
it's not a nsa approved crosscut shredder , but it shreds up my bills and scrap paper to add to my worm bin quite well .
okay this is the one i should have gotten before ! xlnt and fast service , sure beats driving 40 miles to town and back .
this tape is invisible on gift wrap paper . exactly what i was looking for and glad that scotch developed this product .
what can you really say . it's exactly what you expect with a little bell like this . if you need one , this will work just fine .
though a bit pricy these are good ink cartridges , store well , install easily . wish they were a few bucks cheaper .
good deal on this binder it is plain but you do not get the devider just the binder .
this is a nice little scale . very handy . well made and seems very high quality . the price is good too .
it is the replacement i needed for one of the handsets . it is easy to program and works perfectly . it was also received quickly .
works very well . much less cost than the brother ones . i have used 4 of these with no problems at all . recommend if you need one .
soft grip , thick graphite , love the 12 pack . no comparison for the price . put several everywhere and you will always have one in your hand :)
this works on my old shredder and makes it run much more efficient.bottle will last beyond my life line .
nice size and colors , but the whole note is sticky on one side unlike other post it pads , and it is too sticky .
these are too small to even bee noticed . they might be nice for kids to play with but not for important messages you want your family to see .
this is a great product , but i will continue my practice of giving 3 star reviews to products that are blatant price gouges .
i will order this product again . it lasts a long time and the quality is good . i recommend this product .
what more can you say ? they work fine in my new bic pencil and come in easy to access packaging .
excellent price . will buy again when needed . always get my pens this way . buying them one at a time is a waste of money .
i love these ! i use purple a lot at the office and this just falls right in to the rest of my supplies ! perfect !
their plastic dividers , they can tear and arent super durable but they hold a good number of pages and work , completely viable
purchase this & you won't use all your money purchasing batteries . save your money that you would use buying batteries on something you want .
what can i say ? it is nice weekly calendar just as described . it seems durable and is what i expected it to be .
work fine , last a reasonable period of time , printer recognizes them , cheap . what else can i say ? la , la , la .
sticky and it holds pages or photos down well . arrived on time and in good condition . not good for wrapping presents because thick .
this ink is excellent in quality , and the price is only a few percent above re-manufactured cartridge prices when you consider amount of ink actually available for use .
this was as always with 3m products - very durable and very easy to use . it saved me a trip to the store to buy it via amazon .
whats there to say . these things last forever . ive been using mine for 4 years without a single issue ever !
very happy with this purchase .. there are enough card spaces and overall its compact and stylish ! i would recommend this to others
this is good paper if you have a canon printer and the price is certainly better than you can buy it locally .
i have tried other brands and always come back to at . easy setup always connects . battery has a long shelf life . answer machine easy to use .
these are sturdy , have the hanger built in , have the plastic tab that you can replace the file name in without mess , etc .
nothing really to say except it works , works pretty well , and its what you expect it to be.definitely recommend for those who use post-its all the time !
this is a great product for my canon laser copier / printer / fax .
my pictures come out drugstore quality with no hassle . having pre-cut 4x6 paper is fantastic for those rare occasions when we want to share prints .
so far it seems great . it is a nice size and the zipper seems to be made very well .
they're good erasers . the reason i only gave three stars , is because it costs more to ship them , than it did to buy them !
i used many of these retractable badge reels . except for the lack of label sticker , these are on par in terms of construction and durability .
this cardstock is nice quality , strong and thick , perfect for printing kids stuff to laminate . great price , nowhere else could beat it .
simple no frills compact desk ( or wall mount ) phone . glossy black version looks good . works well . excellent audio . excellent value . highly recommend .
nothing spectacular but served the purpose . it was as described . i put them in a drawer to keep tall things organized .
at first you think you are just getting a box of world-class staples . then you realize they are stored in a handy plastic container ! ! wonderful
excellent price over box office stores . easy to rip and wrap your items . some required 2 layers , but for the price i bought 2 rolls for moving
i have a cheap cannon printer and with this paper i get very high quality pictures for an awesome price . thank you
this tool is so safe that you can hardly find the blade on it . therefore , it's difficult to cut thicker tape or plastic packaging .
i love the g2 pens . they are the best for writing . add a pink barrel and pink ink , and what more could you want .
i bought this product because it was a good price and epson makes a good product . i couldn't be happier with my purchase
while these pens would do in a pinch , i would rate them higher if the ink was better . it took longer to dry and smeared a lot .

these smaller cartridges don't last as long as my big printer cartridges did , but that's the price you pay for an economical , small laser printer .
great product.good way to keep track of your calories.it has a dry erase board with a dry erase pen .
it is a good think for it all ways the black ink some run out first so good think can get it
box was damaged upon arrival , but luckily it didn't damage the product . will order again just hope the box is in better condition next time .
this desk is very nice for the price . i can work anywhere in my house sitting or standing . the storage at the bottom is a nice extra .
not a lot to say about tabbed folders . these will last forever , and i like the bigger tabs for easy reference .
i haven't had any problems with these . i have used about 5 cartridges already . maybe i should be a better writer .
purchasing the ink in this set saves money and gets a pack of photo paper too . i always purchase my ink in the package .

ink works as good as original , colors seem just as brite . saves a lot of money over factory ink .. need more deals like this
used in a black and white laser printer . no curling of the paper , no problems with the paper feed , no static in the paper.will buy again .
this feels well made , and should last for a long time . staples well and easy to load . i recommend especially at this price .
canon makes a really nice scanner and i use it quite a bit for documents and photos in my genealogical work .
none of the stores had this folder . well , exactly what i was looking for . it also has a double sided pocket inside . useful and flexible .
this is just an all around great marker . great for darkening lines in drawings as well . i am completely satisfied .
it holds pop up notes and i use this every day . i'd say it was definitely worth it for the convenience .
this is just what i expected - hanging file folders . no surprises here . they seem very sturdy , which is good .
i've had one of these staplers for nearly a decade and it's a well-priced , strong , steady workhorse . a very good office product to own .

always the best ink for my canon printers is the real thing . nice to get them all in a pack together .
great old product that still works as expected . my favorite tape for many years . it's nice to know that at least one old standby hasn't sacrificed quality .
my husband snores and i cannot sleep without them . i take them when i travel . motels are sooo noisy . love them .
thanks for the quick response for the hewlett packard ink carti was short on ink and you came through quickly
item came damaged because it wasn't in a properly sized package . it was crammed into a box that was too small to hold it and thus was bent .
because of its size , it is easily placed in a house or office and it does a good job .
making photo prints uses a lot of ink . this helps address that problem . same quality prints as standard capacity cartridge .
one of the better highlighters i have used . i like the transparent view to see how much of that yellow liquid is left . not disappointed at all .
this package is a good value as it includes 4x6 photo paper . but , as usual , ink is too expensive overall .
these cover the text well , and work as well as the more expensive ones you get at the stores . i recommend them .
wish i could return these-they run just like the others into surrounding colors . used on muslin fabric project , will try on a firmer type of fabric
this works great . we use the 99019 labels for our tyvek mailers.this shoots out a bar-coded address label in about three seconds .

get the generic ink unless you want really good quality for photos . just too expensive for my blood . good ink though .
this came in handy for my college classes . this would be great for english classes too . i would recommend this product for others to use .
see my review on the same item ( for black ink ) . had problems with the ink drying up inside the cartridge .
always prints without a hiccup . recognizes chip every time ! i , ll buy these again . price is awesome compared to the canon oem cartridges .
the papers aren't individually rapped in packages , they are just loosely in the box , but didn't have a problem . they didn't come damaged as some people mentioned
electric staplers do not work as well and are not as reliable as manuals . they require electricity to work and fail after a year's usage .
have bought from these people many times . ink is fine rarely had a problem . certainly cheaper than epson could ever be .
colorful prints but not adequate for placing on my laptop as it constantly slides off . i wouldn't recommend purchasing this item . save your money .
surprisingly , it sticks , and stays at the same place for months , and with light / moderate use , i have juice in all of them still .
i'm going to use these markers to do zentangle art on fabric , so when the fabric is washed , it doesn't erase the artwork . should work fine .

it's tape . has a tendency to break if you don't exercise a little caution . good price though if you need something for small jobs .
there isn't too much to say about this other than these are pencils of good quality for a good price .
these are ink pens but write like gel pens . they write smooth without skipping . they've been working out well for me and don't regret having purchased them .
the real deal . this is the actual scotch brand double stick tape . the vendor sent it out quick . very pleased .
these are nice and efficient moving boxes . typical quality . i'm moving cross-country and the pricing on these is much better than what my movers would have charged .
need a lot of envelopes to put all the paper work in to keep 4 accounts seperated and on file
this is a thin mouse pad , but does the job well . optical mouse rolls across smoothly without jiggling the cursor . colors are vibrant , as pictured .
the only issue i have with these is that they were not the best quality so they probably won't hold up long .
the expiration date was 2 years out , plenty of time to be use , especially if u use ur printer a lot like we do .
these stools are great ! we have them at our bar that is at a kitchen counter height . they are very comfortable and durable .
i needed just black ink and works on my canon printer . what else more can i say its just an ink cartridge .

great quality for the low price . very sturdy and it doesn't hide in the binder it serves the purpose very well .
great item . works very well , i use it a lot , probably need buy some more , it works great , very very good item ...
balance and materials for higher quality prints and gallery showings . for me it rivals ilford and about half the cost .
this is a fun notepad for my fridge . it stays on perfectly the pages are easy to remove and it looks really nice too .
i love not having to have someone take me to the store to purchase my inc so this is a great way for me to keep stock .
bought extra color ink cartridge for new epson printer . love the way it looks on paper
this cannon ink goes along way . what i do to save purchasing more is to use grayscale whenever possible . that will save you a lot of money .
the box is very very easy to put together and seems to be able to hold a good amount of weight .
what can you say about plastic letter openers ? well , they appear well-made and work as expected . also , the price was excellent .
the range is good and the clarity can not be beat in my opinion . the options are just what i needed for my purposes .
it feels a bit watery and i wish the blue color was richer and darker . i like the shape of the bottle .
it is just simple mouse pad can use with all type of mouse . i am ok with it no problem at all
buy hp ink and never get screwed , they just work as promised , the same goes for their printers too best in the business .

nothing like an original brother although you can't tell the difference as much with a drum as you can with a toner .
very very strong and thick tape , more than enough to seal any package . you can't go wrong with scotch tape and this product is no different .
everyone in the office likes these . they like that the labels can be easily placed on the units . no complaints so far .
i get many , many , many , sheets of paper out of these ink cartridges . i have only replaced once since i purchased the computer .
love this tape . it definitely disappears when wrapping two sheets of paper which makes it great for professional looking wrapped packages ! i would call this a re-purchase !
these envelopes are top of the line quality and secure , with a great self seal adhesive solution.these spank other brands we've used .
i like the way they write and the colors are bright and consistent when writing . i would buy them again .
i am absolutely pleased with this five star 3 - pack . there is no other notebook brand that can compete with five-star quality .
with a product like this , it either works or doesn't work . this works ! don't hesitate to buy . great for filing .

using this one on my canon printer , it's works very well and give you free photo paper , wonderful things .
standard hp cartridge - worked fine . but if you opt for free delivery ( nice ) allow for pretty slow arrival of the product .
scotch magic tape is excellent for all sorts of uses . i work in a school and the uses of this tape are limitless ! !

this is a lovely ink . it's not dark , nor is it light , but i would call it ... meditative . .
the hp color printer cartridge prints the colors it is supposed to and is fairly crisp .

i first seen a organizing consultant use these on a youtube video.they really straiten out a filing system . i can not say enough good about them

came on time , as usual . no words to describe as this is a product that i use all of the time .
these permanent markers work well . they provide the bold print i wanted but with the fine point you can still write small letters without everything smearing together .
to those looking for a quality photo printer , this is a very user friendly , quality printer . the color is exceptional .
oem or factory cartridges are always best and this one works perfectly . simply plug , play and print with no headaches .
i grade all my papers and write countless messages to students with these . also , when i'm power grading , organizing homework by pen color actually helps !

this ink has never failed . seem to go through it twice a year ( and i print out about a dozen pages daily ) .
decent ink , but comes with a syringe with out the needle or a fine tip for refilling . use rubber gloves

this product works as advertised . what are there to say about a simple bookend . it simply works . the size is right and it works

great scanner . low profile , and only a usb connection . i am not thrilled with provided software , but it works .
this is a great size for my extra coupons . i organize them by date of expiration and i'm sure not what i did without it before !
its ok but the pentel graph gear 1000 automatic drafting pencil is much better .

much better than a standard mouse pad . a little garish for my taste and i wish that the rest was a tad softer but i'm lovin ' it !
i've used several of them now and they have all worked without exception . the pricing is competitive with refilling and they are more reliable than refilled ones .
works very well for school projects and does not drain the batteries as other pointer / presenters have for me in the past .
don't understand the purpose of these - precut labels are more efficient . there is no point to this product . i would not pay for it .
this is a handy option to keep those invaluable post-it notes handy . they are in sight , and not as apt to walk off or become misplaced .
good . i like it . it looks good on my billy book stand and 1 i am using in my bed room ... . its good .
i used pro paper before but needed something cheaper for printing on the spot . everyone who purchased photos that day was very happy .
these note tabs work great in our office and help identify projects underway and completed . we could have used one more color but that's okay we will improvise .

love this gadget ! does a really great job , pencils are nice and sharp in short order ; i won't use my manual sharpener much anymore .

the non-slip cork base really make this an awesome ruler . it's easy to read lettering combined with accurate markings make this a no-brainer purchase !
good quality prints at a very good price . paper strength as disappointing but the images were vivid , but not the best photo quality
these are great ! they stick very well , plenty of space for writing an address , and seem very durable . will purchase in the future !
there are cheaper labels out there , but avery usually gives consistent results . the dark backing allow you to re-use boxes so that's a big plus .
i found that this white pen was not as opaque as other white gel pens i have used , so i probably would not purchase this one again .

when i can find these double packs here locally , which is almost never , i have to pay a lot more for them .
these phones work just great . i purchased an extra phone so now i have 6 of them . i have had no problems with them .
the quality provides a gentle blending even when used over graphite . and therefore i can say these are not only useful where color is concerned .
simple , nice paper tags . the best part is the strings that have a fastener which makes them easy to use & secure .
i think it was defective . the printer wouldn't recognize the cartridge . i have ordered another one . hopefully it will work .

so far , i've only needed to use one of the color cartridges . it is fine and i presume the rest will be also .

great labels that are easy to use with your shippers . takes the struggle out of cutting and pasting .
oem ink is the best ! canon ink and papers are the best when used with a canon printer like a canon mx459 .
love the pastel colors , help brighten things up.the design is different but you easily get used to it.smooth writing and ink flow . 9 out of 10 rating .
it does the job , it has given me good use , but what all can one say about a mouse pad ?

canon papers give the best rendition to photos . would recommend canon papers to anyone printing photos to frame at home .

the hp ink is fine . it prints well.but the prompts from hp about the cartridges running out of ink are not at all accurate .
easy to install . produces clear , crisp black and white copies without any smudges or streaks . lasts through a fairly high number of copies .
i've always been a fan of the tops daily agenda . thought this may be an alternate but decided this is too generic for my needs .
the printer design allows accumulation of crud so when you install this keep your fingers away from the cradle it rides in , otherwise it's ok .
i get it through amazon at such a good price . i have a canon 3 in 1 and i love it .
reinforced tape for packaging in a handy dispenser . great for sending boxes with heavy items . i have tried cheaper stuff , but scotch makes the best .
works well for the price and for being a generic battery . it gets the job done , holds a charge and charges .

this is an awesome product . nice texture and thickness for many types of projects . not to mention a great price too !
this is one of the best staplers you could ever use.strong , sleek looking , and very durable.loads easily . takes little effort .
these are well made and strong , we use these often , they do seem to get lost though because everyone likes them
i staple canvas to frames for artwork so i am picky about what i use . these staples work best for my needs .
these are large pushpins , which you can't really tell from the picture . you'll need a deep cork board to hold them .
we do a lot of shipping ... and we use these all the time . you cannot get a better deal than this bulk deal .

this is really really heavy_duty . so i don't use it for normal class , normally just use it for storing pages . very good item .
its ok but just does not last very long i only print in black but the color always runs out way before the black does.but it is good quality .
these are easy to set up in microsoft word . avery has a template that can be downloaded . simply print and apply to the dvd .
this is a truly outstanding printer ! ! and since i will not make prints wider than 17 inches , this size is absolutely perfect for me !
my wife was terribly jealous when my new chrome stapler arrived . nice , solid piece of equipment that staples very well and looks cool . treat yourself !
works fine but needs better usage instructions . but it does it's function well and is very bright and colorful . much better than thumb tacks .
when buying this , make sure these are oem and new products and not the outdated and remanufactured type or you will be sending them back like i did .
these white shipping labels with trueblock technology do cover quite well . they seem to perform as stated and i am quite pleased .
they can hold stuff in there . but it's super breakable ! too delicate from what i have . but it's good if you need for school or something .
i love that there is no licking - just peal and mail ! the quality of the paper is nice and over all just what i was looking for .
still use this to this day , the speakers are great and the fans are amazing as well , all told a must buy !
i expected better from avery . they are okay - but pages do not slide in easily - it seems like it will work better for smaller pages ...
definitely a welcome addition to small post it notes ... use these all over my office and keep me much more organized ... to do lists .
great for price paid.nothing special but it works.great for my daughter to get used to the pens.they are long lasting too
these are simple to use . an easy download into word and they printed great . the peel was easy and looked amazing on the envelopes !
this ink cartridge is xl large capacity . it will last 4x the life of a regular cartridge for a lesser price than standard ones .
i've been using these for quite some time , and they work well . the printer recognizes them just fine , and they last a reasonable amount of time .
competitive price for the quantity . this should last quite a long time around the office and serve all of our packaging / mailing needs for some time .
totally enjoy it - it was smaller than i thought it would be out the box , but i can still manage to weigh 18x14 boxes on it !
i bought two of these because of there reliability and compact-ability . they work great with batteries that i use at the office
i read reviews about how big this pad is , but i still wasn't prepared for how big it is . exactly what i needed .
then my four-year-old dropped the container and the chalk shattered into a thousand pieces . amazon says i need more words .
just what the kids needed for school . it arrived in new condition and was just what i wanted . kenwebmasterabout facts net
the sharpie chisel point assortment is perfect . great variety of colors and very useful . the markers are great quality . thank you .
used these for our save the dates . next time i'll splurge and get the adhesive self-sealing envelopes - but , hey , you can't beat this price !
these refills are perfect for the fine cross ballpoint pen . they are genuine cross brand , very good writing quality , and at a very competitive price
i like this pen cup because the acrylic is strong and heavy . the appearance is very elegant and nice for classic office desk .
good price for a general use scribble pad but for things i need to document in a file , i will buy heavier paper tablets .
i don't know how much you can say about this product , it is tape after all.but it works good and does the job .
it's notebook paper … what's to say . the package was intact , and the lines were clear . not much else to describe .
so far so good ... just clear and almost invisible when you want that . wish they came in jumbo size like the colorful ones do .
this is an item that does what it says it does . comes in good shape and works well . what more can i say ?
i like to use these as i have a few different inks , and i can swap back and forth when the mood strikes for a new color .
i've always been pleased with avery products in the past and these labels are no exception . the quality is good and the easy-peel feature is very convenient .
i love having this on my desk & being able to have the dates right in front of me & have notes that i make right there to see .
some works some don'trated 5 star cuz it feels good in the handdoesn't feel cheap at all
i needed these for my target practice with black targets to make the hits and misses . does the job well

labels are bright and peel easily . they adhere well to my crushed velvet and make a great presentation . easy to use .
this is a great product and is what i wanted . just sucks i have to buy my own supplies for work .
once again ... rave review for oval sticky print and usethey are great . my kids write on them and i print on them.used for lots of things !
sharpies are the best markers on the market . if you want a long lasting marking at a great price look no further .
every single day i'm using it for papers from the office and personal things as well . the rubber-band broke early , but the file itself held together well .
regular markers dry out too quickly . these work great and i use them all the time to draw fine lines .
i will never love ink because of the price but compared to hp this ink is really affordable and i wish my printer didnt break .
i like these refills for my parker pen as they writes smoothly . but personally i wish it could be darker .
this pilot better retractable ballpoint pen , fine point is great . i love the way it writes . it never skips . i highly recommend it .
i like these pens as i can set off marks on drawings and documents . quality seems good as well . no broken pens thus far .
good quality ink , but as with others they dont fill to top . average ink life .
i would recommend them to anyone and i really like the way that they work so well and with so much ease .
it is just what i needed to organize the stuff on my desk . it is sturdy and looks good , especially for the price ! !
good signal ! and i think it works well , but i cannot only keep the base silent , which makes me a little annoying .
the reason elmer's glue has been around for so long and is such a commonly used glue is because it works exactly as needed .
the envelopes are great . they fit what i needed them for and the press seals are a perk . the price was good , too .
i use this for grading since red is supposed to make students anxious and it's very rare one of them writes in green , so it is always noticeable
love these chalks . the colors are vibrant , they write smoothly , erase very easily and the dust is minimal . highly recommend !
i love these erasable markers . they dry quickly and there is no horrible odor .. great value also . i recommend them .
you expect tape to do a couple tasks : adhere and disappear.scotch does both . 3 rolls ... means more of what tape needs to do .
great product and price . business-minded people can't be without them ( ink cartridges ) . make that purchase ... now
when i print a tabloid full photoworkforce 1100 vs workforce 7010the wf 7010 has it beat with about 20 seconds on best settings .
i laminate all of my activities in my classroom . these are great laminating sheets . i use these at least once a week and cannot get enough .
i love these highlighters . all the color of sharpies , but beautiful highlighters . click-able is the only way to go :)
this stapler does take a lot less effort than most . but it's pretty big and hefty . also , it doesn't come with even one row of staples .
i bought this for husbands desk for all his clutter it is made very well nice an heavy holds alot of stuff .
i love these the most because of the self adhesive tops of the envelope . they are strong and durable . good value
these are good quality envelopes that excel at hiding the contents ; which is the reason i bought them . i would recommend them .
it is as if you turned your home phone into a smartphone . i love this company ! it is the best !
these envelopes are the perfect size for those quarter-fold cards . they look nice and the flap seals well . they are not too thin , either .
use this for presentations and anything that needs to look better than just a file copygreat price - great quality
simple product . does exactly what i need it to . cant say anything bad about it . very happy with the purchase .
can't beat staedtler quality . the perfect size to fit just about anywhere , great metal build quality and most importantly , does its job very well .
not meant for my printer although it popped up when i looked for my printers toner . very deceiving in the search engine .
that's the way i like things in my life - simple and easy - and setup / use of this is both !
horrible pencil sharpener , doesn't work , all it does is break off the tips . you get what you pay for . terrible .
nothing special but high quality and bright . i have been using for several months now and no loss of brightness or edge . good value .
in my 37.5 years as a teacher , this stapler was the only choice for fastening very thick pages of paper .
i love canon ink over hp inks , i think these lasts much longer and amazon almost always has the best price .
i just moved houses and needed a little help getting the paperwork monster under control . this item helps me categorize and keep things organized .
these are great quality , they don't rip or tear , they don't have sharp edges , they have a good capacity . they're exactly what i needed !
i have always ordered the original canon product and have never been disappointed . ink works as it should and the xl lasts longer than the basic ink .
it was not remarkable in in its performance , but did what it was supposed to while i owned it . word .
i needed a larger mesh up to put a few pairs of scissor in , and this was a great bargain .
canon , expensive but excellent . wish they would lower price to be competetive with non-oem . on averagetwice as expensive as third party carts .
we've used part of the first ream and the paper works great . i'll order these again when i need them.thank you , jeff

these labels are really good . lets you apply and remove later when you reorganize your file . i recommend them !
i really like this package cutter . it works well , easy to hold . safer then other package cutters i have used . highly recommend .
this ink is every bit as good as the manufacturer's product it replaces and much cheaper .
bought this for my desk at school ... however i'm bad at measurements so it didn't fitwould be better for a more industrial setting , seems extremely durable !
my hometown recycle center will not allow me to place the pencils when done into recycling . that's my only complaint . these pencils are terrific .
the ink from hp is fine . but the prompts from hp about how low the cartridges are is not at all accurate .
i sell these here at my stained glass shop in indy . these cork back rules are a very good value .
this thing works very well and seems highly accurate . i have been running it on batteries for ease of transport and battery life is excellent .
it is ok great for organizing , the glue is a bit weak ... but all in all it seems durable and has many uses .
so naturally i replaced it with exactly the same item - sans a few technological advances - but not many.this is a classic and it's all you'll ever need .
i loved using this product in my school printer . i often had to buy ink myself due to lack of funds
we use this to tie up all sorts of things inside the house and in the garage , it's so much easier to use than ties or string !
when i saw this online i thought it was pretty cool but when i got it home it wasn't what i thought it was feels pretty cheap
does its job without fuss . has a nice staple puller and staples in it . very sturdy . great for someone looking for a stapler .
sophia global is pretty good at times and lasts longer than most other cheap inks but some work and some don't
i put my tape into the dispenser , and the dispenser dispenses said tape . what more could you ask for ? the price was great too !
2 x 3 feet is the perfect size for my office wall . not too heavy and easy to put up . price is good , too !
excellent . this product is lovely and is very good for use in my new printer and it is very useful
the dispenser is weighted with sand so it stays in place when you don't have a free hand . works great .
good value over avery labels . works just like them . no problems using these at all .
this device needs to be held very firmly while scanning any document . if you move too fast the document / photo will be distorted ..
it's a bell what can you say . press the button and it dings ... works as you would expect . no complaints at all .
it's ok . i use it . expect to waste 6 inches once in awhile unless you are very careful .
i've rarely had a problem with an hp product , from ink cartridges to workhorse printers . this works fine and came in the packaging as described .
nothing fancy . a basic office staple . it takes standard staples , works like it is supposed to , and has not jammed yet .
i have to order to frequently , do not really print that much , and ordering the xl does not last much longer if at all .
this product is easy to use , neat and professional . i use it to mount and organize my digital art portfolio.it helps me organize my visual library .
this wire mesh wastebasket is simply beautiful . i really like it and it is very well built - not much else to say . but it with confidence .
it's a nifty idea , and i was a bit skeptical at first , but i think it works fine . it's kind of cute too .
needed a good basic envelope and these fit thebill so to speak . and they are auto seal so that'snice too ,
it ; s inky , prints , makes pretty pictures , nothing special here , its just ink , no cure for cancer , nothing more significant . nada
this cartridge is relatively easy to replace and lasts for at a few months at moderate printing . canon software is pretty useful for helping spot low ink levels .
these are perfect for card stock or file folders . they are too heavy for paper . very strong and stick until you take them off . nice color .
now this fellowes powershred w - 11c 11 sheet cross-cut shredder ( 3103201 ) is a good buy . strong and does not block at all .
i used sharpie's at worked , and now that i'm retired i find the need is still there for so many tasks . and they never run dry .
makes working at home an option when preparing things for my classroom . saves time and provides me with a way to work on my schedule .
love them and would recommend these uni-ball 207 retractable medium point gel pens to anyone thinking about buying them and they write nice . 100 % please with these pens
i needed red lead and this works quite well . just keep in mind that the shipping is 7 times the price of the product .
i so totaaly love the bold writing and the colors are awesome . my grandkids simpley love them and the different colors keep them excited ...
i have found this to be a pretty straightforward easy calculator . compact , but the buttons aren't so small that you hit three at once ...

great price for the ink and quick deliver too ! what more can you ask for ? better priced than i could find locally .
i can't really rate this yet , because i didn't know that i needed another device to make them work . they look great though .
they work fine with no problems . while they are dated , my old printer - a photosmart c5280 - never cared about it and worked fine .
very nice , can mount with supplied double stick tape or offers a plate to put a desk . would fit nicely centered on door or by doorbell .
nice ! like the design , but if you apply lots of pressure when you write , these aren't the pens for you because the tips get ruined :(
if you have kids that can't use mechanical pencils in school , then these are the way to go . they are the best pencils you can buy .
i use markers a lot at work and these are a good value then buying them at most retail or office stores . i would buy again .
purchased these to use for family history documents . works out very well . the slanted rings allow easy turning of pages and editing.would recommend this item .
beast quality packing tape ever . the other brands don't work as well - just wish you got a little more for the money !
taking one star off because the gray color is meh . who wants a rainy-day gray , boring and depressing colored notes on their stuff ? :)
incredibly bright labels . adhesive is strong . text printed on these labels looks bold and bright . great value - - couldn't ask for more for the price !
this 8 package is great . shouldn't run out of ink for a day or two . would recommend this set for the average writer . easy to use .
i like this wastebasket . i got the set with the desktop accessory holder . works great and looks great on my floor .
the 654 ink cartridge is the same ( photo in the red box ) . it works well with the 654 xl black .
helps to protect my recipes , photos sheets , etc . they are just what i wanted and will be used for many projects
it was a lot less expensive than the canon brand but it only worked for a few copies than it stopped making copies .
avery labels are my favorite brand of labels . the work great on my laser printer . i use these to label my catalogs and other business supplies .
they are just what they say they are . i hope to use them in my hymnal to keep track of the hymns chosen for that particular service .
wipes off easily w no " ghost " of the marking . doesn't stink . i do wish the point was a little finer .
i used it for a king size temper pedic mattress and box spring and it worked just fine . a good deal .
the sharpener itself is good quality , however it is not very large so you will have to empty it a lot .
the garbage can is actually pretty big , which i like for my office since i throw a lot of papers and envelopes away on a daily basis .
i caught this product while a good special was going on . i've had no issues with spreading needed documents and i haven't had any issues with jammed papers .

i like the sharpies , they hold up and last a great long while . i have never had any issues with them .
it is super sticky and reusable , far better than the typical sticky notes . i use these to label my aromatherapy bottles and they stay on !
perfect printer , very easy setup , fast and there are many suppliers of toner for this one . the cartridges cost as little as $ 8 .
use this in the kitchen on the wall to write on , is very nice calendar to see and large enough space to write stuff on .
they work well , but if you don't use it for a long time it will dry up and make it impossible to write with .
works with no problem - as good as oem for a small fraction of the price
this marker pen is perfect for what i wanted ; extra fine point . they last a long time & don't dry up as quickly as most others .
they're staples . they staple things ? do what the box says , fit well into my matching swingline stapler . would buy again .
these tabs are more substantial than i expected . they are angled , and i think best used for recipe & craft books .
i'm starting my own business and these are working out perfect for setting files up for my clients . avery does a good job on all of their products .
purchase these all the time for my stapler . not much one can say , except they work , real jamming to speak of .

typical 3m quality , it's perfect.regrettably , it is manufactured in communist china . this product is easy to use and the lamination pouches are fairly inexpensive .
a package of 100 envelopes ... security envelopes at that and the special gift of self-seal . the price was a steal too ! thanks amazon !

what can i say ? excellent tape , almost invisible . dispenser works well . nothing new , no surprises .
this was a fun , cute , convenient product but i'm not crazy about specialty tape refills . i'm good with the standard roll of tape and the desktop dispenser
much nicer than even the other quartet markers i reviewed . i also like that they are slim as i was never a fan of the fatter markers .
these envelopes are decent . neither amazing nor poor . i probably wouldn't order in the future ad you can get better quality for far cheaper in similar brands .

this bubble wrap was shipped in a bag . it held up just fine . i have no complaints on the quality . i would buy again .
i got these to help me sort my rubber stamps . into groups that i belong to than into different categories . animal , insect , holidays . etc
these are plain ole cheap 2 pocket folders with the 3 tangs in the middle to hold some three hole punched papers .
prefer to buy this product online verses in the stores . shopping from home is a convenience . the price could always be less but it's reasonable .
fell apart within two weeks . had to return . case it has the worst quality i have ever seen in binders . would not recommend .
this is perfect for helping me keep track of important paperwork and to hang reminders where everyone will see .
for small laminating jobs this is a must . why spend money and time going to staples , office depot etc . when you can do this job yourself .
these cartridges are fine for what i use them for and last as well as i'd expect . and you can't beat the price .
no difference that i could see between these and those which cost more at usual office supply source , so no reason not to save a few bucks .

this is awesome easy and a pleasure to deal ! ! ! much recommendedeasy to use easy to put staples in it

love the pink . :) and the price of this color seems to be competitively priced , so that was good too .
all the quality that you would expect from sticky notes , but you can see through them as well . great idea .
if you do a lot of small technical writing , get the extra fine nib . this pen performs perfectly though . comfortable .
great paper , no complaints . i like the pricing of the item . again , the pricing was competitive because this can be purchased anywhere .
hey what is there to say ? its a phone ! but i am verry happy with it it is easy to use - thank you
i think the picture is self explanatory . what else can i really say ? its a metal ruler . it does its job
like the convenience of self-seal , but if i were ordering again i'd specify an opaque self-sealer . nonetheless i'm satisfied with the envelopes i received .
they are kind of cheap looking but they are colored pens so they do the job.if you go through pens a lot then i would recommend these !
these labels work as well as any labels you may purchase , but have the nice added feature that they are made from recycled products .
i had to replace my old all-in-one printer . this one ended up to be my choice . at only $ 150 i paid it is a very solid printer
i returned it twice , thinking that it was just a lemon ... but this brand is not good . find another brand instead .
i ordered these and have installed one . i have yet to discover how many copies i will get , but the quality of the ink is good .
convenient to have when you need to find out how heavy an envelope or parcel is . very accurate and easy to use .
the quality is ok , but it took a week to straighten out with weights . next time i'll just get one already flat at the store .
what can i say about plain envelopes other than they appear to be as described . i just tried to find the cheapest ones i could get .
. . . with the advantage of not having to drill into the wall to set up.eight kids . busy schedule . this is easily workable.need i say more ?
prints are sharp with great color saturation . what more can you ask for from photo paper ?
decided to upgrade to a new printer . the small compact size and wireless features are really good for smartphones
this is a great replacement that is always needed . colors work and replace quickly . i would recommend this for your printer as needed .
this 88xl is offered at the lowest price i can find . i have ordered these several time and have never been disappointed . i high recommend this item .
the case is much more than i expected . it holds the scanner , cord , and card adapter . i highly recommend it !
i love saving money by buying these from amazon . great product for some great prices . the multi-pack is another cost saving cool thing ! !
as a teacher , it's nice to find a resource of cheap school supplies as i am constantly having to replace them . :)
they work just fine , quality seems ok . it's hard to write a rave review about a #10 envelope oh yeah and they were cheap
i received the correct number of boxes of clips as stated in the product review . excellent value for the price .
good for the money , cleaned up my messy desk to be a lot more organized . would recommend to others . thanks !
this tape is good quality tape and a fantastic price on amazon . it is not too thin like some tape so it doesn't get twisted a lot .
their easy to use and much better then ink pens and more clean . worth buying to me ! ! ! i love these pens
wow , what a nice surprise . these are strong and solid . and they really grip . i like these better than the 1 " ones !
the ink works well and the xl is supposed to hold more ink . i have an ink jet hp 8600 pro plus and it works perfectly .
excellent for all in one documents . the paper is smooth and when printed on it shows results that are great quality .
this is a replacement ink for my mx870 canon printer . this original canon product works flawlessly . there were no problems encountered .
these are nice pens with good ink characteristics and are comfortable to write with.the price for a 12 pack makes them irresistible.recommended
i got these to give to a teacher for a gift and i think for the price they are a great product !

these are such lovely vibrant colors ; really sharp and clear and bright . they show up wonderfully on dark paper . very pleased with the effect .
i like this 3 - tier tower . holds my paperclips , small memo notes , and miscellaneous items without taking up a lot of room on my desk .
i have my grandfather's ellis island passenger record stored in the display pocket.sadly , i was surprised to discover that there was only one in the package .
i use them daily before they are needed for a torn hole . i print out a lot of recipes making a cookbook . great for extra protection .
with 5000 staples and a staple remover , this swingline is a bonus.it is light weight but has a firm pinch on paper .
products works well and had no problems with 12 + sheets of paper . a negative would have to be the noise level , it is very noticeable .
my favorite packaging tape . it's the only kind i use . i keep the red handles and i buy these replacements when i run out of tape .
always need pens as was good for a stocking stuffer . cheap and a whole box . the price u would pay for one pen u get a whole box
works perfect for both my boss's laptops ( one is much larger ) . it brings it up to eye-level perfectly and she really likes it .
i love this correction tape because it works every time ; as opposed to several others i've tried , which left me frustrated .
swingline is " name " in staplers , and this does not disappoint ! i wanted just a basic stapler near the printer , a well priced item !
they are just as described . they are hanging folders , what else can i say . the price was right and they arrived quickly . would buy again .
great for when you're out of ink - i try to order combo packs whenever i can . that way i have both colors available
printbquality is great i love this piece easy to instal and easy to use last very long i am sooooooo . happy
this is a pretty good pen , overall quite beautiful.the one drawback would be its weight.just a bit hefty for a standard pen.but otherwise a unique and pleasant design .
it feels nice in the hand but i think it's a tad overpriced for what you're getting . the fine nib writes fatty lines .
the stick its work and are fine . can't get too excited about this type of product one way or the other .
i'd buy this again . my only wish was for a reasonably priced recallibration weight ( 10 kg ) . i'd buy this again .

cartridge arrived promptly and was well-packaged . x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
needed something for my mom to alert me if she is having a problem ( she's 93 ) . works great ! nice sound .
just got it and hooked it up . works well , but no directions for using the scanner.give us clear and complete directions to use your product
the colors are pretty but the functionality is not all that different from 3m ' s sticky notes . this is a great size for multi-purpose uses .

perfect for a teacher who likes to color code certain handouts so the students can find them easier . really nice for a great price .

junk plastic , which is made flumsy . never spend your money on such a thing . spend a little more and get something that would stay together .
full of features and the resolution is outstanding.love the ability to just push a button and have it pop out the result .
used once so far and it seems to reproduce colors and black and white very well , and should be very economical for refills .
this is a great stapler , and it takes common standaerd staples.it ' s easy to load with new staples , and can staple multiple pieces of paper.recommended !
the software doesn't work correctly . the directions are difficult to understand . never again . i tried to scan pix for a show and it was a mess .

i used the envelopes to mail out my computer generated christmas cards . the grip-seal was very helpful in sealing a stack of envelopes .
bic is my go to brand for pens . these are even better because they are 74 % recycled plastic , so i can feel good about using them .
this is a lot of tape for a good price with the dispenser . i ordered a few and i recommend them .
first of all , the super tab idea is a long time coming . these make home or office organization a snap . great quality folders !

perfect for my little one's nursery . we are using it for pictures and reminders . it would also be great in an office .

this is a good price . it was the perfect replacement ... i have no complaints . it is what i expected in a print cartridge .
not bad . if you can get it at a better price than the 3m it will do the trick . at the same price stick wih the 3m

yep , it's a box of paper ... that's what it is ... a big heavy box of paper ... it's paper ! what more can i say ? !
standard filler paper , slightly on the thin ( translucent ) side but works well for writing notes and such ...

i don't know how long this thing is going to last , so i'll give it 4 stars for outward appearance of quality .

this paper is actually better than i thought it would be . it's strong and holds pictures beautifully . will buy again .
i bought these for my scotch tape holder and i couldn't find a better price anywhere else . its a lot of tape .
good for absent-minded people like me - you cannot make mistakes with this one - one piece at a time .
it works fine , but there's nothing special this stapler in either its looks or functionality . i didn't feel a significant reduction in effort in stapling pages together .
i liked these yellow legal pads . they tear very easily at the top , like they should , and do not rip unevenly
it's paper , it's white , it does not jamb in my machine , and the price is right . what more is their to say ?
i love this . it is so easy to use & in a way better than the one that sits on the desk . makes nice lables .
i use these over labels that won't peel completely off when returning an item that doesn't come with a return label .
very good price ! this will last a long time ! does it job and that's all there is to it . great price !
a must at the office . everything requires labeling with a permanent marker . don't know how we would function without a sharpie
this scanner is a nice scanner if you don't mind that it is a bit slow . in would buy another if i needed one .

these for some reason were hard to erase from the board , not sure why . i had to use a cleaner .

these pens are relatively inexpensive and relatively high-end in terms of performance . i enjoy using them , and they write flawlessly . highly recommended .
works as advertised . we have used these ink cartridges for several years and have never experience any problems with them .
good quality and cheap for the amount you get . didn't come in a fancy packaging but the labels were clean and works just as the avery .
as always , this is an old faithful that never gets lost . put it on the wall and you can always find it !
this tape is much thicker and stronger than any of the packing tape i have bought in the past . it stick also sticks well .
i'm using these to make cupcake boxes and it's a great quality cardstock . folds nicely , cuts easily , and holds together well in a craft project .
how much can you say about lead refills for you mechanical pencils . pentel makes a great product . i think that is enough said .
i use this ink for my home based small business . it is adequate ... exactly what you would expect from ink designed for inkjet printers .
i have tried different types of paper but this kind is the best . the print quality is on point for my photography business .
this is a great stapler from the stapler masters , swingline.it takes normal , regular standard size staples that are sold at many stores.recommended .
fantastic price for these poly mailers . i love using these to send packages , they work well in the mail and are tough .
it works . buy nothing but the original . using other than canon and you are asking for trouble .
i bought this after i saw the great reviews on it . i neglected to investigate if it is mac compatible . had to return it
i really like these pens . they flow smoothly and really fit your hand properly . i bought a set of black , blue , and multi-colored .
great product , clear scans . nice size for the home office . highly recommend . great addition to my computer desk .
amazon consistently beats the retail price on this product . i order them about twice a year - like socks , i don't know where they disappear to !
just like in my office - - - plain , understated but holds an incredible amount of pens , scissors and other things - - - highly recommend ...
very good product to use for times when you need temporary tabbing for a project . when done , remove and reuse .
if you're looking for the little page flags , these are the ones i highly recommend . they are more effective and easier to use than that other brand .
too much fun . just as great as here comes the abcs . go . get it . you know you want it !
would review this product , but , it arrived with the pen shattered and dried out completely . so now i have to buy my own pen .
works well for a basic model-efficient use in shredding-glad to find one at this price .
nice cards , low price , free fast shipping . i am happy for sure !
i am very satisfied with these labels . they are easy to work with and look great .
this does its job well on mx 882 and mx 892hate it when cheap ones don't work but these work well so highly recommend
every time i look for these pens they are gone because everyone likes them as much as i do . the price was also very reasonable .
it is so much easier to mail stuffs now . i sell stuffs on ebay a lot , this is a great investment
not really as soft as i would have liked it . because of this , it's too high for my apple keyboard . good quality construction though .
accurate printing on hp multipurpose paper , but cartridge gets empty fast and must be replaced . xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
this tool becomes very easy to use once you get familiar with it . only problem i have is the teeth to cut the tape seems a little dull .
except to itself . it's good enough for sticking paper to paper , or maybe a wall , but anything heavier might not bond very well .
these envelopes are not as big inside as they say they are . i had to run my hands i side the sides to loosen them enough to fit .
i poured 128 fluid ounces of tuscan whole milk into this and it leaked all over my fridge . a poor quality product !
i use this to laminate photos or business cards . this is perfect for what i needed it for . i also want to laminate newspaper articles
