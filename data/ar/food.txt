the ekobrew allows you even more flexibility with your keurig . it's great for loose teas or for coffees that you currently can't get in k-cup versions .
it looks very good . potatoes and some beans . delicious sauce . i put over a chicken cutlet for dinner last night . it was great .
i like a very strong brew and this really works for me . i have tried others but i like this best .

gave up the other and have been eating these oats for the past year . eat them at least five days a week ; good stuff .
the taste is ok , but the texture is odd and it bothers my stomach . just too healthy for me , i guess !

only 150 calories , tastes good , 20 grams protein . grab and go . just wish they were a little cheaper than they are .
strong coffee with average coffee taste . in the starbucks category as i see it .
maybe it is because we have so many great flavors of k cups in our house , but this hazelnut is not one of our favorites .
lots of flavor and crunch ! my family enjoyed them to eat by themselves or with some cheese . would love to try other flavors , too !
i bought these on here because they were out of them at my local grocery store . all cans came dent free . they were all 2014 expiration date .
the seeds came well packaged and quickly . i just don't like them . i wanted to try them but don't like them at all .
i liked the taste of this product , but it has too many carbs for me .
i knew these were minis but they just take too much time to open enough to get the chocolate craving satisfied .
indulge the guilty pleasure with this healthy snack ! tastes as good as your favorite candy , with reduced fat .
what a deal ! i could not beat the price anywhere . this brand is sooo popular and hard to find . i know where to go next time .
pricey but wonderful indulgence ... probably a good thing it only is available once a year . in my opinion the best thing dove offers .
it is just okay to me . this product's flavor does not impress me as much as the vegan choc chunk ones offered by erin .
for people trying to cut down on coffee or want to mix this up to create a delicious nutritious drink in the morning , this is it .

i'm now a full convert to the current coconut water food trend . this particular brand has a good price here on amazon .
raisins are great . this comes in a large package but if you are eating them every day or so then you can go through this package easily .

these kit-kats are very good , but if you're looking for a strong green tea flavor - you will be disappointed . the green tea flavor is very subtle .

almonds are a super snack and at that price dear family get to enjoy a healthy , economically friendly to the budget night time nibbley .
this granola is wonderful . i don't eat it solo , it's a treat added to my other less flavorable breakfast cereals .

way to powdery tasting and bad aftertaste . plus the price i could not believe for this junk ! skip and stay with countrytime lemonade ! yuck !

i drink all types of teas , but this is one of the worst tasting teas , in my opinion .
i love this coffee ! i use it on the keurig machine on the larger cup size and it makes a very mild and tasty cup of coffee .
these almonds are tasty but they are coated with vegetable / sunflower oil . wish they were just dry roasted . at least they arrived fresh and not rancid !
this is on auto purchase . we eat it as a snack , use it instead of wheat or corn crackers with toppings.the whole family like theses .
it's okay , but there is not much of an onion taste in the food i've used it in . maybe , that's a good thing . lol .
ordered this for the first time and we love it . i'm particularly fond of flavored coffees and this one is a new favorite . really nice taste .

this powder is great and mixes well with cold iced tea . it is a little pricey but the taste and texture is very good .
tasted way too gritty and bland . i tried one and through out the rest .
planters really are the best , and the lightly salted version allows more peanut flavor to shine through rather than just saltiness .
does not taste like decaf . smooth , no aftertaste . great coffee experience if you don't brew larger than a 7oz cup .
it arrived on time , and is as expected , very tasty olive oil . would recommend it anytime to anybody in search of a olive oil .
better than sugar i use it all the time and nobody in the house realizes that it's not sugar .
this made plain chicken more interesting but was not very flavorful . it really needed more so i added some of my own spices .
starburst fave reds are excellent because , they only contain my favorite flavors . a sweet and tangy treat , conveniently individually wrapped .
i love these corn flakes with blueberries and soy milk . i've never had any better , and they're gluten free !
this is true flour versus the flour / meal that so many others sell so it has more applications and is the best for finely textured baked goods .
this is good stuff . i really splurge on this for myself . makes up for the gluten free pancakes i have to eat .
the product has a good taste . i have not used it very much . i will be adding it to my smoothies for the nutrition .
this flavor is not quite as robust as their fog chaser and breakfast blend brands . it is however an excellent coffee and works great in the keurig brewer .
good , fairly strong flavor . smooth body . little aftertaste . sure beats all the green mountain coffee for keurig i had ordered before .
i use this in my coffee every morning instead of sugar , much better . no weird aftertaste , its great ! i will definitely keep buying !
these were obviously fresh and had not been sitting around like some of these eggs . the texture of the center was the perfect consistency .
delicious product ... my husband is cuban and he likes these even though the sodium content is a little high , great tasting product
the green mountain coffee decaf sampler was perfect even though there were just four different types of coffee to sample . taste was spot-on .
amazon ? really ? $ 12.99 ? is that a joke ? i just bought this same exact item at whole foods for $ 4.99 .
first time trying this tea out , was told it was good for many things . and yes i like it and will buy again .
loved the caramel hot chocolate ! the irish crème is tasty too , but the salted caramel is to die for !
i order a lot of community coffee and this is probably my second favorite behind french roast . its very affordable and better than starbucks crap coffee
this mix has an excellent flavor of apple always enjoy having a cup anytime of the day , but a second is better
this is just one big box of crackers . not many little bags . my kids had it gone in one day flat .

this cereal is so good , and even my husband likes it . we go through a couple of boxes a month .
if you enjoy the regular senseo pods and like a lighter coffee you will enjoy this one .
these are way tastier than i expected them to be . i discovered that i liked both the flavor and the texture .
it also did pretty wonderful things to my molasses crackles , because the crunchier sugar added to the texture . very pleased .
the cookies are tasty enough , but this is a very small box and just a little on the expensive side .

i found the flavor to be great . i am not a flavored coffee drinker ... but i would do this one everytime .
i prefer the ekobrew cup because they are easier to clean . but this one works the same and allows me to use my own coffee beans .
the ingredients are similar to other drinks i've had but there is a very strong aftertaste of sucrose that makes it undrinkable .
good quality , i like the can vs the plastic bags some other milks come in . but the price isn't great
nice way to get healthy foods ; great bagging and easy to open which is always a plus with small sized contents !
great taste has is east to make . sometimes i don't want a whole pot of coffee . this fills the bill .

i love the treats but they need a box of chocolates . wait that sounds familair . they came to afghanistan earlier than expected
this is a really big pack . you might want to divide it into smaller zip lock bags to keep it from getting sticky .
dove is among the chocolates i reach for when shopping for my or my friends sweet tooth . always great quality and taste .

newman's own organic chocolate is pretty good . it may have a little waxy taste than other dark chocolates , but it has a nice consistency .

this is great quality tea . very fresh and tasty . will buy this again . it is a good tea for relaxing .
my wife loves this coffee--it is relatively mild but just bold enough . it has a very good flavor . i will buy this coffee again .
good cup of sencha tea , nothing special for this price . i guess paying extra for extra packaging .
this soda is worth the extra money ! i try very hard to stay away from regular soda . the rootbeer is really good . there is no aftertaste .

forget all those high-priced energy drinks ... 1-2 tsps of this in anything will give you more energy than you've ever imagined.it was shocking !
i feel this product adds to my healthy diet . it tastes good , is relatively unrefined and provides lots of anti-oxidant protection .

if your kids or grandkids like suckers , please get these . my grandson loves these & since there is no hfcs it's a double plus !
fresh and tasty , good for cooking . makes great date nut bars , or any other holiday cookies . good source of fiber .
... but then it kind of got old , pumpkin pie for breakfast . i'll miss them when they aren't available , but i think i overdid it .

these are the best . love the smaller ones . love these even more . i love haribo gummy's !
although they're filling , the double-chocolate taste is really chalky . i prefer the peanut-butter-chocolate flavor over this . better yet , kind bars are even better !

great product . just wish the bottle was larger . i most definitely will be ordering this again . highly recommend this product .

this is a staple for dinner with the family.it doesn't dissolve as quickly as the chemically-ridden drinks you find in your usual grocery stores , but persistence pays .
you will like these . they are rich and heavy . soft and chewy . they are not low-fat.personally , i prefer the crunchier pecan varieties .

ok , i think i'm addicted to mio energy drinks , i go through it very fast and still love drinking it .

previous review says you may not like this without sugar or honey ... i love this with nothing added . nice lemony taste .
pleasing aroma and taste . i used it for cooking all the times especially for frying as it will withstand high temperature without degrading its beneficial effects .

i did not care for this coffee and did not find it worth the money . i have not bought it again .
these hot chili pops are great ! not to hot but not ho-hum . great tastes in both types but everyone has their favorite .
searching for a brand of k cups that i like , tried out this one and wasn't too impressed with it .
if you are expecting this to taste like soy sauce , it does not . perhaps with a little experimentation i can improve the flavor . it needs it .
i over eat the salted ones so the raw ones slow me down and are a great snack . the price is good so buy it .

the milk tastes very good though ; however , the bag is much smaller than one would think a pound would be .
i ordered these and expected them sealed . but two of the three were opened already . nothing was eaten , but they were not trusted after that .

still waiting on my wings . in the mean time , this is the best price i've found on redbull in a long time .
great bulk buy because the gummies come in 12 packages vs . one bulk bag . worth a little more to keep them fresh .
the flavors blend with a range of cereals and works in homemade cookies and breads . it even makes regular vanilla ice cream a real treat .
i found the orange flavor to be rather bitter , more like orange zest . they weren't terrible , but not my favorite .
flavors well . great for a busy household and for someone that wants to eat good food but does not have the time to cook .
great high protein snack ... but tastes like paperr and i hate the sugar grinds around the chips , just not good and off ...
we tried the donut shop kcups and the flavor is pretty awesome it has a very nice flavor we are very happy
love this , red is a little different tasting but it is a good taste but i will go back to the reg .
very fresh whole flowers with some powder toward the bottom . but all makes a great cup of chamomile tea . the re-sealable foil pouch lasts through many re-sealings .
i thought this would be a rich , dark coffee but it's quite ordinary . not very aromatic . it doesn't taste bad or bitter .
i love a good snack . sun chips are a great , more healthy alternative to regular old chips . excellent buy and price .

about the only thing i don't put it on is icecream ! ! i will never go back to tabasco sauce again ...

i have been very please with this purchase . great taste and very fresh . looking for to my second order . thanks
i purchased this tea as a gift for my niece who lives in another state . i personally like yogi teas and she reports that she loves it .

as an insulin dependent diabetic , i am always looking for diabetic friendly products and this one is a keeper . thanks .

i decided to give this one a try for a variety of reasons . it seems on the week side and i prefer something stronger .
overall this product appears to be healthy . i just did not care for the taste or consistency of the bar .

this coffee is sooo good . it doesn't have a bitter taste , and it is not too strong . i love that it's organic . highly recommend it .
i did not like this . i have liked other products from celestial . i just won't get this one again . not much else to say .
$ 25 for a box of flavored water that is barely 5 % real juice .. no wonder it's only 5 calories .. it's water .

i purchased these upon recommendation from my daughter-in-law . i like to mix them with almonds , craisins , etc . for a healthier , yummy snack .
this was tasty and properly crunchy , but it was best with a few fresh berries scattered on top . a healthy breakfast treat !

i never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the taste . thanks again .
if you have a keurig and a taste for sleepytime - - my favorite celestial seasomings tea - - you are going to love these pods .
in my opion these is the best brand of paprika on the market . i really enjoy both flavors , but most of all the hot !
these are great for flavoring and garnishing your coffees and lattes . good , rich flavors ... just what you would expect from ghirardelli .

this turns out to be a great substitute for dessert for me ! it's got the right amount of crunch and sweetness . that said , it's really overpriced .
i was on the fence and then glad i tried this product , it does not make your food tasteike coconut . shipped fast
this is one of the best coconut waters i have tried . my only complaint is i couldn't stop drinking them . :)
we buy this for the office . it's a good basic blend , not spectacular . perfect for your everyday cuppa joe , but not my favorite coffee .
when you get planters .. you know exactly what you are getting .. good stuff at a good price here at amazon . go for it ~
i love adding this powder to my smoothies in the morning . fantastic peanut butter taste without the fat and calories !
besides being great graham crackers , the packaging is perfect . just the right size to put in a lunch bag , or for a snack . very pleased .
we love it and it taste the same as regular sugar but this is lower calories and we will buy more . we recommend it .
this is a good alternative to artificially sweetened caffeine free cola , but blue sky is better and less expensive , and i've switched to that super saver subscription .
great discovery ! ! ! these are so good it is hard not to eat the entire bag in on setting . backpacking must .
it taste good , but it is too pricy . with this price , i would purchase it in whole food or trader joe .
trying to lose a few pounds , i really like the quality and taste of these bars . kind of small in size , but big on taste !
found this weak and like the phony cappuccinos you buy at 7-11 . none my favorite that is for sure . i ended up giving it away
kudos for making a drink that uses stevia instead of sugar , but this particular is unpleasant . i found it to be undrinkable .
the first bowl of this had gone bad . if the other bowls are better , i'll update and let you know .
i found this weak in flavor , haven't figured out the reason , but i won't buy it again . i will returnto using rodelle .
and made with all natural ingredients ... not like the fake stuff i used to get in the store . i just wish it was lower in calories ...
this is one of my favorites and i drink it every day ! ! i would highly recommend this yo any tea lover
it's sugar ... a 10 lb bag of sugar . fresh , tasty , and sweet . not much more i can say about sugar now .
i love this bold , brisk tea . it really is a perfect everyday cup for me . i went through my first pack of six in six weeks !
delicious , just a tad pricey for the wee bit you get in each package . the quality is excellent but way overpriced , even for the convenience .
my kids thought they were ok but not great maybe we just do not like dark chocolate . seasonal item at amazon .
ok , but nothing to write home about . they taste l like every other similar bar . too pricey for what they are .
this is a very healthy tea to drink , and has become impossible to find at local grocery stores . purchased in this fashion is also a good savings .
love pop tarts and the brown sugar cinnamon is the best ! other complained that these arrived in pieces but mine were just fine and delicious .
my kids love these cherries ! they eat them as snacks , in oatmeal , etc . love the big bag size .
i prefer langer's organic apple juice . lakewood is too acidic and the cap is too small and hard to remove .
good strong coffee , not as good a flavor as green mountain sumatran . i use biggest cup size on my brewer .
these green mountain hot apple cider k-cups are wonderful for cold mornings at work . it is a wonderful variation to ' just ' coffee !
really delicious - i wish there were more stars for the mcdougall soups . i don't know what i would eat without them !
after reading the positive reviews i decided to take the plunge when this was on sale . it's wonderful and i highly recommend it .
able to get strong coffee by doubling the grind amount and reducing water . great name , though . the flavor is so-so .
it's hard to find this flour for pasta at the grocery store . i found that using half semolina and half white flour worked the best .
this is the best product that i could say my family enjoys daily with oatmeal awesome for great health . would recommend without a doubt ! ! !
if you are a fan of french roast coffee , then this is the one for you . i received the order sooner than promised .
a little salty , but a delightful pick-me-up when out and about or on the road . it's nice they don't require refrigeration and aren't greasy .
kind of a heavy bread , but cut thin and toasted is really good . it does not mold up as soon as some others i have bought .
gave it as a gift and was informed that they like the taste so i cannot say what it taste like
great to add flavor to soups that seem a little watery . if i run out of canned tomatoes this is my substitute .
i am not a big coffee drinker but , this coffee has a mild flavor and i really enjoy it a couple of mornings a week .

i have used this for years in our oatmeal , for baking breads , muffins , pancakes , etc . great addition to a healthy diet .
great chocolate but these are available for $ 1.99 in any decent supermarket . paying $ 3.50 - $ 8.48 per 3.5 oz plus shipping is simply foolish .

it does what it should . i have no leaking , no grounds escaping , no problems . it works fine and i would buy more without hesitation .

these are great for adding a burst of flavor to salads and sandwiches . they also work well for all the usual dishes .
best tasting stevia to me , and love the 4 ounce bottle deal . now if i could find this deal in the orange flavor .

i have been using this dark sumatra coffee from coffee bean direct for over a year and highly recommend it . great cup of coffee .
very good item for an on the go meal . creamy noodles and chicken flavor are so good , hard to beat .
pamela's bars are very tasty and a great snack for a gluten free diet . i keep one in my purse for a quick energy boost .
nice flavor . packaging a little over thought for a pack of gum . i think this is the best of the vitality gums

such a creamy , rich experience , and more filling than most chocolate bars . love the dreamy caramel liquid center and the quality chocolate covering
i bought this curcumin first before realizing curcumin supplements should come with a pepper extract . i'm not sure this works as well as the one with pepper .

i use this allot and it is great use it as the other mix like reg its just as good as the regular mix
great to have so many gluten free pasta choices . this is the only kind i've bought so far , but i'm very happy with it .
the problem with sticking to the diet is in the sauce . you might make a spicy vegetable sauce , maybe a garlicky and clam sauce

i like lightly flavored but this is like water i have to drink 1 4th of it before dropping the flavor cap
really tasty . i boil water in the microwave at work and then i add the oats and dried fruits and yogurt .
use just like you would use bleached white flour . butter , flour , milk and cheese and you have a great cheese sauce for mac and cheese .
when the coffee people say extra bold they mean it . for me personally the coffee was way too strong .
make it according to the back recipe on the box but skip the optional 1 cup cheese . it makes it too salty !

it has a good taste , and i enjoyed eating all of it.for those cool nights especially . i look forward to the next can

this stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells . my son didn't like it either and i ended up throwing it out .

we have tried other vinegars but braggs is the best . always fresh and mild enough for many uses . best price i've found too .

very delicious stevia . i wish the flavour was more intense , but the product leaves no unpleasant aftertaste , even if you use too much ;-)

a lot of beans in this order at a good price . not cheap like in grocery but the taste is better , and i'm pleased .

everything is good about this product & its vendor on amazon.as described , packed well , fresh , arrived quickly ! i will definitely repeat this purchase .

other brands have less dry berries , but if you use them for cooking or soak them in water they're okay ...
we love this tea . i purchased this product after reading food babe's article on pesticides in non-organic teas . this brand was highly reccomended .
love the fact that this is available with a lot less sugar then the other flavors . looking forward to them making the others in the light version
love this oatmeal , it takes a while to cook because it is not the instant saw dust that is usually sold as oatmeal .
love these in my smoothies . a great way to get the taste of chocolate with the calories and sugar . yum .
i don't plan on reordering it , but it was definitely edible and filling since i added chicken .
these were good before christmas at 12.16 for 36 pack 2oz bags now they are double the price with a 3rd party , not right but good cookies

this was sent as a gift for christmas and i was told that the candy was delicious and just melted in you mouth .
the coffee is a lil strong & a lil bitter ... even when using the largest cup size . it's like a very strong cup of folgiers brewed coffee .

mighty leaf is an excellent brand and the quality of their tea bags is awesome . the chamomile citrus is delicious .

great way to have eggs on hand all the time as no longer have a car to get to any store
the packages are small , but what do you expect for 100 calories . they are a nice snack for the kids .

good mixer for coffee . could use a little more chocolate flavor but i do like it . also good with a little raspberry flavoring .
getting unsalted nuts is difficult these days . these are good tasting nuts . some other companies put peanut oil in their nuts . these are peanut free .
i don't make a lot of popcorn so i have nothing to compare to , but when i used it the first time , it seems okay .
love the mix . we use butter rather than oil and milk rather than water . we have changed the recipe up a bit by also adding a sweetner .
i'm not a fan of the other good earth teas which i've tried , but i like the rather strong apricot flavor of this
i love barrie house coffee . the breakfast blend is my favorite of their's . it's med . roast that tastes wonderful in the am . highest recommendations here !

good jelly beans , but not enough licorice flavored , lots of popcorn and red ones , but not black ones . would buy again .
super fine , super flavorful . excellent for making smoothies or to just put on salads . navitas on amazon offers the best price .
have tried one other brand of tahini that cost much more . can't tell the difference in quality or taste . makes awesome hummus and is an unbeatable value .

hotter than i though , but in a good way . great on tacos , and all mexican food in particular . wonderful flavor .
love spam . always have . these packs are convenient for work and home as i control how many i eat . great way to eat a classic .
it'll will be a better product if there is less stevia or licerice in it , whatever that sweet after taste came from which i don't like .
my husband and i loved these cashews . they are such good quality nuts and taste so good . we plan to reorder .
yuck , they really messed it up when they changed the recipe . these taste like solid molasses bars , hardly any licorice flavor at all ! ! !
this was indeed a large bag and we ate them all in a few days . we could eat these forever and ever . thanks so much .
now this is my personal favorite i just love it . the taste is just great . i use only the creamers no other addatives
the aroma upon opeing the lentils was intense and appealing . i was expecting one spice to drown out the others , but it was a symphony of flavors .

this cracker is a family favorite . great taste and perfect bite size pieces . i recommend the subscribe and save option . couldn't be happier with this product
i've tried them all , and twinnings english breakfast is the closest to fresh brewed . oh , wait , it is fresh brewed !

this is the second time i've ordered this coffee . i really like it ! i have found a new regular for my grocery list .
these were just okay tasting . very subtle . but man they are annoying as heck , how all the seeds get impacted between your teeth .
this was more salty than cheesy and didn't stick to the popcorn very well , i will try it a few more times but am not all that impressed .
it tastesterrible taste burnt . i bought this because of the biodegradable packaging but will not purchase it again . nice try !
sometimes decaf coffee that is flavorful is hard to come by . not the case with timothy's . good taste , great prices .

this is soooooo good . so much better for you than the stuff you find at the grocery store .
this cereal is like rice puff clusters . sweet , crunchy and filling . love it !
i was pleasantly surprised . i was expecting the typical flavorless " nuts and twigs " , but like the taste of this .

this is another one of my favorite k-cup teas . love the taste / aroma . get them on amazon's subscribe and save , you won't be sorry .

quick shipment , minimal packing , good price and a great product . we've purchased before and will continue to do so--please don't raise the price .
it starts with the rich aroma from a freshly brewed pot of yuban breakfast blend . the dark roast is very flavorful and offers a delicious blend of tastes .
great sea salt , awesome size for the price . this is the best celtic sea salt you can get . i've been faithfully using it for years
the label says " mild " but i find it a bit too spicy for my taste . there are too many onions in it .
my husband likes this a lot . i like it too but i don't use honey very often . i will probably buy it again .
appreciate organic foods on the market as it is better for us as it is " clean " and well taken care of and it's for every-one ..
i like that this is pure vanilla and doesn't have too many other additives in it . great for all your baking needs !
you will either like it or hate it . it chews a little different that most gums but is free of asparthame and gluten . we like it .

got this as an add on item for less then $ 5 and love the flavor . very creamy and good tasty . will order without the add on

these are by far my favorite 3 coffee flavors . even though it is may , i still like to collection . hard to find out of season .
interesting flavor but probably not one i'd buy more of . it tastes as you'd expect based on the name ... didn't quite work for me .
i keep re ordering the folgers k cups for it's delicious flavor & fantastic value for the 80 count quantity .

i drink this ! one a day , i always eat a piece of fruit with it , omg totally enhances the taste , i'm now hooked on it .
this company offers wonderful products , and lemon burst should be among their best . exceptional !
i am a moderate , one cup a day coffee drinker , so i want that cup to be good . this is my favorite , so far .

we especially like to make gravy with this flour instead of wheat flour . also makes a good pancake with added eggs . good product to have on hand .
apparently , this was developed by a harvard guy in the 1800s . i love the fact that it does not contain aluminum and the powder works great !

cheap . easier than stocking up every time i go to the store or trying to carry cans and cans on my bike . i dig the subscriptin prices too
i shared this package with colleages and asked them to comment . they were gone in minutes and without reservation the consense was mmmmmmmmmmm gooooood . they are delicious .

at only 100 calories this treat is quite the surprise . crunchy with a fruit center . you can eat almost 3 for the comparative calories in a snickers .

these are quite good and filling , i will order again . they are a little on the small side so no sharing :)
the quality of this brand is superb . i love the little almond crunch . perfectly sized for a snack . rich flavor and not too sugary .
not too acidic . mild flavor . very well ground . dark in color . i mix it with other coffees to get the flavor and consistency i want .
adding variety of taste to popcorn and many other snacks you want to zest up . this variety sampler pack gives you some interesting flavors my favorite was the bacon
i bough these to have around for stomach issues , but they are delicious as candy as well . chewy , spicy , not too sweet . individually wrapped .
good stuff but extremely hard and brittle . looks like the glaze over the bar to hold it together made it extremely hard to eat .
organic products are wonderful ! i am very grateful to have the opportunity to be able to order such quality products .
with sweet onion slices and some good bread , this makes a very healthy , tasty lunch . add a salad and it's delightful !
my favorite coffee . thrilled that they come in pods . have the vienna and love it , but especially love the classique .
i love the size of this container , perfect for someone who actually enjoys spicing things up in life . hope this price stays the same .
its soup , and it tastes good , hard to say more to get the 18 words required to get this to work .
like these lots - - not an overpowering taste , just yummy pumkpiny goodness .
lots of chocolate and moist cake dough ... not anything like a new york city boy's memory of babka . really , it isn't ! ! !
this is my favorite tea , and being able to get it decaf is a plus . wonderful on a cold winter night .
these do not even begin to approximate the real thing . completely and utterly flavorless . kids refused to eat , and had to throw the box away .
1000mg sodium per serving makes this extremely salty tasting , cheese has a slight off , bitter taste . definatley wont be buying this again .
this is such a weak product . you can barely taste any tea at all . i will not be reordering anymore .
this is the only brand and style of tuna my cat will ever eat.he gives it 5 claws up !

i really like this stuff . its a great flavored coffee , if you have a keurig i recommend trying this one
this is my favorite decaf k-cup . i also like donut house decaf , but it just depends on the mood i'm in .
i use a lot of cinnamon in my cooking and this size is perfect plus it is a good price . quality is also quite good .
not my favorite bar but of course the taste depends on the person . this is definitely a great deal though ( six boxes for 17 dollars ) .
the popcorn is ok . it is the same as most yellow popcorn with some unpopped kernels , i use an air popper . thanks
these cookies have a decent texture and a very strong ginger taste , so they should be superb for anyone who really loves ginger .
as others have said , the quality is good but shop around . for some odd reason , the same cups can be purchased elsewhere for much less .
this provides a nice enough cup of coffee with a rich , back flavor . however , it's a little too acidic tasting .
i really love the quality of the chocolate and the caramel . my only problem is that i want to eat too many .
this was a good mix , but i was disappointed with the grove square selections . they're instant coffee ! ! that's not what you would expect .
i buy these for the grandchildren . they taste pretty good but great instead if pop . i purchase them in my set and save monthly .
i have yet to master the art of making spring rolls , but these are inexpensive enough to practice on . they are very easy to use .
try using sodastream orange , dr . pete , cola or root beer to instead of sugar to sweeten your cheerios . u will just love it .
although i am a lover of raisins , i thought the price was a little high . would have to reconsider ordering this a second time .
i love love these macadamias . they are fresh , salty enough , and just plain delicious . they almost have a coconut taste to them . so good .
best macadamia nuts i have had in great while . sightly roasted lightly salted . i will order these again , if the price doesn't go up .
i have used this before , and to make my own mac and ch it is a better deal than the box .
the taste is good , but there are always so many husks in with the oats . i'd give this 5 stars if it weren't for that .
i like this brand of tahini - it's a bit more roasted tasting than others i have tried , but i like that about it .
great value , tastes as good as any tahini i have bought but for a third of the price . definitely recommend !
we like the whole grain brown rice and this is very good . the package sizing is convenient .
its like altoids except they don't look as nice , and they are ginger flavor . very strong ginger flavor . keep that in mind when you order .

i tried this after the coffee people donut shop kcup doubled in price . this is very good and far more reasonably priced . go for it !
may just be my taste but i was not overwhelmed here by taste , and it is a tiny seriving . it is convenient to pop in micro .

i keep these at my office . the 1 - ounce size is perfect for curing an upcoming hunger and not eating too much at a time .
i love this stuff . it makes lots of foam which i enjoy . much cheaper than a fancy coffee machine which i was considering .
these seeds are my favorite of all the flavored sunflower seeds and all the brands . they're the perfect nighttime snack .
i feel so luxurious when i special order these because they are more expensive than everyday white sugar cubes but boy it makes a huge difference in the coffee ...
i was looking for an 85 % cocoa bar . once i read the reviews of this bar , i had to give it a try .
low carb , high protein , great crunch , and tastes like the crispy cheese on the edge of the pizza . perfect for grab and go .
this works very well for espresso . i use it in a solis crema espresso machine to make shots and lattes . great flavor for espressos .
if you have a pod coffee maker and want really nice cup of coffee , try these . the flavor is bold and smooth

see my review for numi organic tea aged earl grey for the reasons this brand is virtually my only tea brand to buy for myself or others .
it's got a good flavor but it tastes nothing like indian food . it tastes exactly like coney dog sauce .
i used it today to make cream puff shells . they came out beautifully . i would not hesitate to use it on any recipe requiring ww pastry flour .
seems nice but quality control of great concern in this 5th world nation . could be grown in sewage sludge by cretins
i love to prepare this tea along with a peppermint tea . it is smooth and soothing .

this stuff was stale . and the packages was full of crumbs . buy the one at trader joes instead . bigger bag and better tasting .
this soy sauce tastes great . i would recommend this product for those with gluten / wheat intoleraces . it tastes like other top name brand soy sauces .
very little of either , green tea or honey . it's mostly sweetner , real and artificial , with a touch of tea power . i was really disappointed .
my dog would eat them but he didn't get that excited about them . he's one of those dogs that will eat about anything , including non-food items .
hope they keep it in stock , seems when there's something good it's all gone next time you order .

the water just tastes better out of a glass bottle ... as this plastic stuff doesn't cut it . otherwise , pellegrino is my fav mineral water brand

though i could hope for more varieties included in the bag , they are still hersheys and still chocolate . who could not approve and desire that !

they didn't seem super fresh . they were really hard and had very little flavor . maybe just a bad batch this time .
still taste great even without the dairy and wheat . with these , you can't even tell your on a special diet .
i love the taste of these , but they are definitely not carb free . eating these caused my blood sugar to really spike .
good source of nutrients , easy to add to breakfast cereals . it will be a while before i finish the 4 bags of the chia seeds .

this is some nasty candy . i don't know if it is the texture or just the taste . i sure won't bother looking for these again

i bought this to use with organic flourwhen making biscuits or other baked goods . i have found bob's red mill products to beof very good quality .
i've had 2 of these packages . for years had wished there were more brazil nuts in mixed nut containers . the sincerely nut brand nuts have been great .
this is not the great quality that was expected . looked like it had dirt or some by product in the oil.had to be strained before use .
grandma wins again . lays mixture pleases all the granddaughters . i bought both kinds . i am now a hero . and shipped right to my door .
very good dish . i like mine extra spicy so i load it up with curry but this is a great product

i'm hypoglycemic , and this bar helps me maintain my blood sugar balance with the protein , and helps keep hunger away .

i love the bold cinnamon taste and the subtle sweetness of the cloves . happy to have this tea in decaf so i can enjoy it day or night .

i like all the mcvities ... and especially because i can have something sweet without the fructose corn syrup and gmo's we find in so many of our foods .
i prefer equal exchange but i'm sure it's just a matter of taste . dagoba does have less sugar however the taste seems not as strong .

this peanut butter is delicious and very addictive . give it a try , very glad i decided to try it !

these are really tasty . i have made multiple purchases . they are pricy , so i drink less than i would like .
delicious and i think a more healthful snack than say chips . 2 bags per box it's a 3lb package but still fits in my cupboard ok .
my first time trying this tea , and i loved it , the taste is a little different , but overall it is good tea .
terrible , terrible , terrible - took one bite and threw out the box in the trash because that is where it belongs !
i just hope " organic " means something in china . i didn't find any pinto beans from the u . s . that were organic .
i could not complain about the taste , the only problem i had with the bar is it has too many carbs as compared with other bars
