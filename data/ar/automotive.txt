i am too old to manually work all the jacks on my travel trailer and this makes it easy with a good drill ! !

these are not very bright they barely light up the cab probably wouldn't buy again . must have measured the brightness real close .
i purchased these for a co-worker who need bulbs for his truck . he didn't give me any complaints so i assumed he was happy with them .
i like fram air filters ( not oil ones ) and this one is cheaper on amazon and delivered right to my door !
needed to order one smaller item to get free shipping , and have a motorcycle that will need an oil change soon , so it fit both needs
very high quality microfiber towels for car detailing ! great for drying after a wash , removal of wax or the application of detailing products .
these are strong safety cables . the coil keeps them from getting tangled up in everything . i will buy more of them
this gives me the ability to charge to vehicles at the same time because of the distance from the charger
i got these in delivery and found they work very well and i did sell my scooter so never did get my moneys worth

hooks right up , the jet helps but could allow more flow , but i would recommend to anyone with or without a flush kit
great antenna mount ! very easy to install and really holds my firestik antenna securely in place . i highly recommend this to anyone with a newer jeep wrangler .
caps do the job , noting special , but if you have lost one of your valeve caps these are good replacement for factory

this product works great as support for the camper's sewer hose and stores away very quickly and compact . very happy with the purchase .
my last set of bulbs from sylvania were brighter than these and lasted 5 months longer . the four month life span i got out of these did dissapoint .
they are what you would expect from inexpensive universal car mats . they look and feel sturdy enough and hopefully will serve their duty well .
we can't even get this type of thing in australia - greatest invention ever for rvs ! ! ! it's just so handy !
they work so well , i bought another pack to keep on hand . good even spray with little effort and it uses the whole bottle of liquid .
bought this for my new camper and the system is so easy to use and well built . easy to clean .
just make sure it has a sure footing when placing it , and works just fine , to insure all trailer appliances will work as expected and needed
this filter is cheaper over the long run that buying replacement paper filters . you will also enjoy better filtering and more airflow with this unit .
i have used this before and found it to be great . be sure to let it dry before driving as it will splatter
this is a great value vs the packs of 10 at the camping stores . i will repurchase here only , thanks !
awesome product as usual from mothers.this company never lets me down and always has top quality products for my car ... ~ !
nice quality , with sturdy chrome plating . i keep this in the trunk for emergencies . works well , and provides enough torque to take off stubborn wheels .
these chocks do a great job . they are quick to set up and take down . very sturdy , wheels do not move when these are in .
stiff brushes and good crevice tools for car detailing . worked as expected and about the same price as competing products .
as we all know , dust gets over your rides in the garage , and is nice to be able to dust it off instead of complete re-detail ! .
these did not come with attaching cables as stated , but i made my own . the product works very well . no more insects .
but the lites do go onwill try it when it gets warmer .. got a set or trailer lites from hrbourfreight ... not used yet
but then after about 4 months of use , it just completed stopped working . so i would definitely not buy again .
i've not used this yet . i hope i never need to , actually . if i do , i will certainly update this review . :)
worked great on my oxidized headlight . i should've recharged my drill before doing the second headlight , however . but the results are amazing !
it cleans and polishes , no residue or streaking . it works well on any paint job leaving a high gloss finish which actually repels dirt . highly recommend .
this car wash is the best i have ever used , really suds up and cleans very well you will like the smell of the wash.recommend this product .
it did the job but only for so long . the application lasted about 3 months before another application was required to clear the head lights again .
the brushes are so soft you don't have to worry about scratching your wheels . i'm glad i purchased this item .
changed some oil and transmission fluid with these . works great . would definitely buy again . wish i had a reason to buy more .
the same ones at the local storefront were more costly for the same ones . amazon pricing once again wins again !
bought this for my pup just to keep eye on battery . we dry camp mostly and this item fits the bill . small and easy to use .
these were for our rv and they work great . i have used them several times and once you get used to using them you will like it .
haven't had the chance to use the chains yet . not traveling in much snow . probably will next winter i am sure .
this nice gun worked like a champ , nice features and seems like it will last a long time ! and besides , it matches my rv and truck :-}
great while it lasted , but doesn't last long at all . falling apart after a couple months of weekly use . guess i will try a microfiber mitt .
after buying these towels i don't see myself buying any other brand towels anytime soon ! they are super soft and work very well !
glad to find this product . since my 2013 tundra is so high that i can't even jump up to enter the truck bed .
i purchase nothing but bosch blades . yes , they are more expensive . however , they last longer and clean better than others i have tried .
installed these and you can barely even see , which is not good at all .. now i need to get different ones ...
the item looks to be pretty good quality , however , i am concerned that the cord wires are not thick enough for a heavy load .
looks great and does the same thing as some of the more expensive mats out there . they look sturdy enough to me , time will tell .
love it ... i keep it in my garage in the toolbox and is handy and a snap to use .
just installed it into my 2012 mazda 5 and had no issues.fit was perfect and filtering seems good.will for sure buy again .
was disappointed that it wasn't made in the u . s . a . other that that it looks like it will work out fine .
this washing mitt is very gentle on the finish of a car . after months of use , it hasn't torn any at all . highly recommended .
a must for campers keeps moisture from laying in bumper . the caps allow the bumper to breath and dry out
they fit nicely into the sockets of the tag light of my ' 97 ford expedition . i gladly recommend this article .
still the best tire inflator on the market . very accurate and easy to use . those stick pressure gauges never seem to work well for me
they are great and have good sound . fit well in helmets . worth the money .
i cannot wait ti use this cleaner for my tires and my rims on my car very highly recommended
this brush is the perfect size and has just the right amount of rigitity and softness to clean the many curves and hollows in my wheels .
i think this is a cool yet sweet looking half skull mask and is what it is and thats simply cool
it seems to be well made and is actually maintaining a charge on 2 twelve volts at the same time .
i haven't installed it yet . it looks like it will work ok . i'll let you know when i get it installed .
has the sizes i need and seem well built . do the job required of them and the case is decent for storage .
i use this on my race car and it works very well . i'm considering picking up another for my motorcycle .
these are very nice , very plush drying towels . they are very absorbent & cleaned up very nice after their first use .
trim is everything . this company consistantly makes good products for fair prices . easy install . i also bought the rear units as well .
